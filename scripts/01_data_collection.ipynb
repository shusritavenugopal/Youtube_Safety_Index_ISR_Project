look at your work this now is your chance this is the perfect opportunity there will be a prize pool of $36,000 us so you can check out the link in the description SL pinned comment for more details and lastly the contest admission deadline is on February 28th 20125 which is a couple months from now so you have some time but you know you should get started because that that time catches up and you guys know art takes a lot of time very excited what do we have today and guess who's also joining the contest us that's right U and dius is joined the contest also so yeah you we could win I I don't think so we could I don't know about I hope we win do you anyways what we have here is that we have a bunch of rough names and name is basically just a Japanese word for rough manga where you panel you show the panels you showcase your your the most messiest sketches just trying to get the point across and we are going to present to you our ideas of a plot and characters and all that jazz I think we've seen manga names before right at like manga exhibits pretty cool you know what what is difficult while we're doing this for 3 days straight in all those cafes we went to cafes and we just we went manga mode and we're just like a little Cor was really hard it was hard but very fun but what I learned while doing it is that the wordless thing is so hard it makes it so much more difficult I so badly wanted to use a speech bubble that just said this is this place or this does that and I'm like nope you can't nope nope no no it makes you realize like how much you need the context of like actual words yeah so now it just feels like we're just storyboarding for like an animatic or something yeah anyways so I'll showcase mine and then Emily will showcase hers and we'll explain since it's worthless we'll explain each panel and go along so this this is what we're going to be showing to the kadokawa manga editor so that's the other exciting part we're going to have our rough draft looked at by an actual manga editor so they're going to tell us what changes we could probably do so this is not what we're submitting this is just like step one basically and we're going to poop ourselves as they look over our uh our works and judge it accordingly ass go back to the I'm going to suck new manga new manga all right I will go first mhm and what we have here is just a notebook so it can it looks like a manga I guess as you're flipping it so are you going to give like a one sentence synopsis or are you just going to go balls balls deep I'm going balls deep I'm just going to explain what's happening on each panel and hopefully you guys could tell and the that the editor that's about to look over my manga I hope she understands what I'm drawing that's my main concern we got squid closeup of a squid looks good and then DUS is chewing something and he's looking at the squid obviously I hope that's easy to read M and then here we are it it's not you know this is by the way this is a rough okay this is not exactly what it's going to look like it's just like hey it's a city with CA elements in it mhm and technically it's not underwater I know it's too hard to explain that was just a drawing but I would I would like to explain it as if like water and air has combined into one and and um if you're looking at a fish tank you will see all the floating sea creatures but like there's no water in the tank it's very hard to describe it's like the setting that you have in your that you illustrate in your videos yeah kind of yeah yeah and it's kind of like SpongeBob but not underwater cuz SpongeBob is technically underwater this is like SpongeBob but like like I said the water and air is combined into one and it makes this weird atmosphere world I know it's too hard to tell just from this one drawing I'm just explaining my thought process of this panel typically the reader is just going to be like oh it's like sea creatures with with a city and like people in it because these are people walking here I know there scribbles here mhm no no I think it's clear daus is it's zoomed out and DUS is looking at the floating squid next page we got a sea cat looking thing and it's rubbing on his leg I said flip whole page horizontal anyways cat's rubbing on the leg daus looks down he makes this really like happy grin face oh cute he puts his hand in a bag of dried squid yeah cannibals so he can do that he presents the food to the cat the cat looks at him I mean looks at the food and then he looks up and then he steals daus's hat there there's his hat obviously I'm going to jum better the the final but he's like ah my hat ah give it back here he runs after the cat and then the cat's in this little like you know crevice Alleyway he takes a peak and then he goes inside then you see there's an Alleyway and DD's just like ah there you are you cat and he's on a trash can he's on a trash can he's looking cute but it's very dark down here obviously I'm going to use reference uh when I have to do backgrounds so I can establish the world better but yeah basically and then D look at the cat di goes oh it's so cute come here come here give me the Hat I'm going to go grab it his hand moves slowly cat's looking Chom and then he goes the cat runs into the back of the alleyway and then he disappears into the shadow D his puts his hat back on and as you can see he has a bite mark here on his glove I know it's hard to I'm going to draw better when the final but yeah he puts his hat back on and then this guy comes out of the shadows and he's like what the what the heck is going on here daus has a shocked face being like what the what's going on this Jack dude comes out with the cat on his shoulder and he's petting the cat and he looks you know he's up to no good obviously cuz he's hiding in an alley he's hiding in Alle and then DUS looks uh you can see from the light that three henchmen have appeared behind him then the bad guy is uh petting the cat because I wanted to make it seem like the cat is kind of working for this guy or like this guy trained this cat to like lar people two people into the alleyway yep and then he has this little face and then he he does the JoJo walking approach he's like are you approaching me uh we have D going oh God and he's like cornered basically we have he's doing the uh give me money kind of because I can't have words yeah I this is really creative this creative though yeah thank you thank you I'm glad con it's readable I'm glad it's readable he's rubbing his little grubby little fingers can't wait to get money from you DUS is basically saying I don't got anything I'm I'm a broke boy and then he goes huh and then here we have the three hunchman those are mouss and they're going because they know what's going to go down and this gu goes I'm going to punch you because you don't you got my money and then D this is like a big Freeze Frame it um and then you see a tentacle coming out grabbing the guy's hand arm stopping his punch and you can see like the shadow here because it's like it was very close to his face and then d goes uh you know he's going to do his thing go slide his foot and then he's going a and he throws him with his squid arm and then he goes and then this is a out of the alleyway and there's a big explosion going as in like he so hard yeah very shown it I was going for Shon it the three guys in Smoke are like oh wow who what happened and then here comes the smoke at the end of the alleyway this is one panel by the way um you see all the mess here and D is like kind of tired he got a little breath yeah hair and the smoke is clearing and you see the guy's like he's still alive obviously cuz he's he's he's a scary bad guy you know it's not that easy you see his form I want to illustrate this better in the final but he he has like this fin coming out of his so basically he's transforming into a shark man and he rushes towards daus this is when I had like one day left to to do this rough draft because literally tomorrow we're going to the editing the editor uh so I kind of rushed his editing but anyways the the guy comes in he goes ah and he turns around and then he poops ink I mean not poops he farts ink sorry sorry he farts ink it's go it's a zoom out again but you see ink Cloud instead and then the birds are like and then didus here is climbing a building it's really hard to tell but and then here's the ink cloud and he's covered in ink because he exploded himself I really like you know what I like sorry not to cut you off I really like that you kind of Twisted the arm to show that it's in still in tentacle mode oh yeah I think that's really Co it's easier to climb that way it's showing how he's climbing I like it and right here I know it's a small detail but this is the cat again and he just he you know he's a bad guy so he's like biting onto daus's leg here so he's coming along for the ride and so he escapes by climbing and then this guy I mean all the bad guys are just Inked Up and they're just like well he climbed the I'm not chasing him you they're just done and they look tired so then here we are time passing with the birds call call ch ch ch ding dong ding dong here's the door it opens and there's fat guy in send but the readers most readers won't know who the these characters are they open the door and and daus is covered completely in ink and he has this little cat thing biting on his leg and then they are looking at him we go to the final page and he they see that uh the cat's biting on his leg they go oh my God oh my God and then they they they pet it cuz it's so cute and then D is just here being like what the what why whoa you're not going to question me you only care about the cat and that's the ending that I have until like the editor tells me to change things I I I'm I'm guessing that there's going to be some changes right yeah I like it though this is very cute I feel like it's it's really clear yeah you think so that was my main my main concern is just like I I hope like my name is easy to see what's going on mhm I I just want to make the drawings clear enough like obviously I'm going to make the throwing scene better and all the other scenes better in the background but at least you know what's going on right what I'm thinking is like like okay so for me I'm not a big fan of Shonen so I look at these action scenes and I'm like damn this is going to be like rough to like ink and Screen tone but for you be so hard I feel like you you're like looking forward to it I I don't know because like this is a looks good already no I want to make this a better perspective and like I this panel might completely change like in the final and even this because I need a reference I need to go in an Alleyway and take a picture okay of so I a lot of the characters that I'm going to draw like the where where they're positioned it's depending on the reference photo that I took so I'm going to read draw them according to the reference basically um so a lot of these panels will change and I might change this better uh because I kind of want to see his face here it's kind of cut off but I didn't want to redraw this panel cuz I was in a hurry but I would have his face showing I think being being like uh you like make a little fart face you know uh yeah and I I wanted to show that like this this guy's coming from far away and he's going CL close cuz he's like rushing towards him mhm so maybe one more panel of like this guy getting really close dies before he farts yeah oh yeah true true true okay but yeah that's that's this is good and I hope that I establish that like it's basically humans would like they can morph into sea creatures that's my whole stick it's a shown in where daus is he has that's why at the beginning he was looking oh sorry that that why at the beginning he was looking at a squid cuz he's like oh my God just like me for real and I wanted to Showcase that like even like the villains I mean I didn't say it loud it's not you can't read it maybe in the future but like these guys would be a mix of something like maybe a fish yeah well I think for this like like one shot submission I feel like it it might work better to just keep them like in Shadow yeah because then the focus is put on datis and this guy like these guys don't have to do anything yeah I think I'm getting too ahead of myself here I I'm just let's just keep it as a one shot here I kind of like that they're just faceless goons sorry featureless goons like it's just they're just goons that's their role oh you think I should keep them as features Goons later too or just like actual just like looking henchmen dudes um I if you were to continue this story unless they were to make a reappearance just make them look really basic yeah thanks for this interaction they should just look like regular featureless goes but yeah that's that's my uh manga so far mhm I am super nervous to show this to the editor tomorrow I feel like I'm just going to expect to get reamed it's fine I'm going to poop my pants for sure my expectations for myself are very low for this all by the way guys I am sorry but like I I tried my best but like pencil is very hard to capture on camera so I had to play around with the the colorings and everything I hope you guys can see it clearly I'm sorry it's just pencil it's pencil I'm sorry so Emily will present her Manga Here We Go oh just to note by the way we you probably already noticed with dauses but we did ours right to left uh I don't actually know if it's a requirement to do it right to left in the description but we did it that way because that's probably what the manga editors are used to and manga is traditionally um right to left I only did it cuz I read I read so much manga that just that's just what you're used to yeah I was just too used to it yeah it you know it was fun to try out that kind of paneling but anyways mine my one word synopsis is it's a monster exterminator witch who's bad at her job so this is actually this is not her final design but this is a character I've been like cooking up in my head for like a while so I want to illustrate it here I'm just worried that anything involving like magic and that kind of World building kind of requires text right so I feel like this will be a little hard to follow but we'll see let me get your thoughts on it so we have uh the titular character the witch character she's at this house she's really nervous she takes a deep breath really nervous she walks up to the doorbell and then before she's even able to press it the lady of the house opens the door and she's like oh oh my God should I wait should I even like describe like what it's supposed to depict okay yeah I'll just do that she's like oh you see her hand is still up this yeah I like you explaining every pen okay cuz um yeah the editor is not going to have this kind of context oh yeah anyways Lady of the house opens the door and she's like oh my God please help me and then the main character is like like cuz you know she's startled she's taken a b and then she gets pulled into the house it's very urgent matter clearly and the lady is showing her her living room and basically readers don't have this context unfortunately but she's like hey there's like a monster in my house I don't know what to do like please help me she's like yeah of course it's my job he so she raises her staff does her little Hocus Pocus magic thing she presses it to the ceiling and then Taps it twice she looks up she's like focusing all her energy and then her staff glows cuz it detected something and they're like a there's a presence here and so she moves her staff down with the magical energy and those like little smoke clouds with a little wind yeah with the wind because she's she's about to reveal this creature and you see its form slowly take shape in the clouds and she's like ooh wow like I did it it I revealed it and it turns out to be this giant spider and she is horrified and froz like Frozen in fear so then this panel is supposed to show wordlessly that like she screamed really loud and that's why there's birds flying out of tre coming out of the tree little action lines and then the next is like a giant panel of her like freaking out and running away from this spider monster and then the lady's like ah a lot of chaos happening and then as she's running she trips on the carpet Falls over spider's like whoo and then she as she's getting up she sees her staff that like fell to the ground and then she reaches for it and then while she's on the ground she tries to blast it it's standing still by the way this is D cuz she's closing her eyes that's why she can't aim yeah yeah she's panicking she's closing her eyes so she's missing her little magic missiles are like whiffing and then she's like destroying parts of like this bookcase and L's like ah ah my first edition books no ow and then she aims again misses and then there's like a three-part panel of the beam like shooting past the lady explodes and then there's like smoke and dust on the wait wouldn't the explosion be revers here really yeah it is hitting here would the explosion go like this oh you're right oh we'll fix that later okay I'll fix that later whoops and then she finally man this part's a little cluttered but uh she finally manages to hit it this is not clear but this is the monster like you know that dissipating yeah the blast we like uh there is a way to draw it I think you can draw it this is just rough yeah yeah and then she looks over and she's like oh and she managed to get rid of it she finally killed it she exterminated the monster and then the lady is looking at her in horror even though she's like I did it haha because even though she got rid of the monster it was at the expense of literally the entire house no which the living room is now in tramples not the vas and yeah that's a cute ending I like the ending you like I think this page is my favorite out of all those pages well well well that is your clumsy witch yeah my clumsy clumsy witch who's bad at her job so clean your names well yeah Okay the reason it's clean looking is because this was like my rough rough draft I mean it doesn't look that much different but this is when I was just trying to figure out like how to present the sequence of events so as you can see there's some stuff that I changed after I asked datus for his input yeah so this is this is like super rough sketch compared to this yeah that is my name so I guess if I were to make like an actual if I were an actual manga and like creating names it probably look more similar to this where but because I want to make it a little more visually easy to follow I no text yeah cuz no text if there were text this would help me so guys let me tell you if you guys are entering this contest that's is the hardest part it's literally a hardest part make sure you tell a story that can be easily told through no words because I unfortunately this is like a scene that I already had in my head for a while but with text and I was trying to I think my mistake was like I was trying to figure out how to tell it by removing the like text bubbles that would be there but I didn't you know it's it it's just difficult especially when you're doing like magic you you kind of need words to describe what's happening like when when the spider is invisible and shows up it's hard to describe without words right yeah um but yeah yeah it's cute very cute yeah thanks I'm happy I made it m yeah um that is both for mangas yeah and and guess what we're doing to tomorrow oh we're going to go present it to a kado Ka manga editor I'm just we will get destroyed I'm scared I'm scared she's going to be like why are you wasting my time with this no they wouldn't do that they would maybe politely but it it's still like this is our first time right have you have you ever been to a real editor no that edits for manga no I haven't that like publishes and manga that sell no I'm SC I'm scared exactly this is terrifying it's a good opportunity though but hey yeah yeah I'm glad to have this opportunity I actually I'm excited but terrified at the same time so yeah so yeah that's happening tomorrow and um you know what guess what this is one video you get to watch it right now yeah all right all right let's cut to the next day boom bye wish us like bye [Music] thank you so much for having us um I'm really grateful that we got to have this opportunity to have our work checked out but I'm very nervous oh yeah okay yeah thank you for coming today and today I I will check your okay so what what is this p 10 I guess Shonen Shen Shen e mhm I guess what is it about it's a city that is a mix of like ocean and air but it's combined into one and uh so there's floating fish and floating squid around but there's also buildings but they're also not breathing water it's like kind of like this sea theme ocean theme mhm mhm he's like a mix of squid and human um and each person is kind of a mix of a sea creature such as like a shark you know normal people would probably be fish like fish men not um but it's not very um they don't have like visual cues they just transform part of their bodies so he transforms his arm into a squid tentacle and combat and then come back yeah so I like this oh really oh thank Youk oh wow thank you and a water cat it's it's kind of like a water cat water yes I'm showing that the yeah that's exactly what I'm showing yep yeah so I was trying to show that he just he bites him and then hides into the back Alleyway but he left his hat so then on this panel he has two hands here and he's just putting it back on tug I was using the cat as a plot device MH to get him into the alleyway because he will not get attacked in broad daylight so he has a I used the cat and the hat you should also the cat is like used by the right and here the cat is on his bad guy's shoulder so it looks like he trained the cat to get people to come to the alleyway so he can mug them like this this is why he's petting the cats right here too because he's showing that they know each other oh those are um these are new characters that haven't shown yet I think it's like a cliffhanger for like he's home um because here he Rings doorbell it's this is his roommates roommates he is biting his leg here after he escapes and he just came along and he's still biting onci bring him home yeah he accidentally brings the cat home oh God for producing new characters on a one shot it's dangerous so cuz you know who they are but the average person won't know right right I see I see I see [Music] but right now she says that it seems it feels like a onot manga instead of a continuation instead of something that has a continuation because if it were to be something that has a continuation that would probably be another way of ending it because right now if you have how do I put this wrapped up things very nicely so well that it seems like a one shot so that's why she thought it was a one shot but if you do want for it to continue that's why you introduc more characters there probably might have been like other plot devices you could have thrown in somewhere to make the reader understand that oh it's not a one shot it's going to continue after this for for me what I was going for uh in introducing these characters was only because I thought that the viewers reading it would want to know who these character are next chapter but maybe for the manga contest like you should just leave it with the conclusion on this page just maybe have yeah because I feel like this contest is more for one shot right oh I'm glad she knew what was drawing I'm glad she she also understood that too was I can't use words it's so hard without words I I'm very happy that uh it's under it's readable like [Music] bit I think I I agree with that and this is because there's no words yeah I can't be like d just goes home for your like contest submission do you think you're just going to like end it at the like ending conclusion with a cat on his leg yeah maybe he just Pets the Nick girl M and then it bites him and it bites him and then that ends is that fine so she says that um you could end it on like a very like think of the two characters showed in just Shadow Silhouettes like mini size and like a Grand Sunset behind them like this is kind of thing for like like a grander scale ah I see I see it's one way you oh if I if I know how have you tried to uh complete the one you you like to write this draft oh I like both I just never did a complete one m not I never did a complete page especially physically maybe digitally I I tried a couple uh but physically uh oh I know it's tempting but it looks so good when it's like like uh physical yeah it looks so good wow I feel good I feel good so the story here is uh it's a witch who works as like a monster exterminator but she's very bad at her job m for oh I think my first draft I started in you have yeah in the first round I I started in this I just transferred over here so so that's put this here uh for reference oh maybe well okay no then this is my most recent draft oh oh you oh this the this is the second version you broke it yeah cuz I needed to use it for reference but this is kind of jumbled actually oh that's okay this is fine then okay okay yeah okay no I didn't draw anything on a double spread for caught you a she's anxious cuz she knows that she'll probably not do a good job cuz she knows she's bad at it first time to visit someone's house for H to like help exterminate like a monster that was in her house that she can't see for yeah I see okay then Rand funny okay for Okay so so so like turning something invisible to become visible without lines is really hard so okay so I should just make it visible from the beginning and then okay then have have it like maybe like run rampant and like oh what do I do help me that kind of interaction okay oh I I don't I didn't really have a Twist in mind so I'm not sure did you plan to have it like a simple straightforward story at first or did you want for for this yes I just wanted to make it like cuz I was trying to think what could I do what could I tell within like eight pages oh okay yeah because of all the action action scenes you've shown there because you're also making use of different like angles and different paneling so that works for this manga oh yeah it's uh it's it's more the same for I think the the only reason why is because we don't have words to give context to the scenes so we feel like we have to make it a little more clear of what we're trying to do otherwise it would be scribbles I think so yes okay okay again oh I mean I'm not going to lie I came into here thinking I was going to have to redo the whole thing [Music] there's a lot of uh people overseas in the states who are interested in publishing their own manga but I imagine it's a lot harder in America than it is in Japan so some people may be wondering would it be easier for someone to become a manga artist if they moved to Japan oh and uh I did some oh so cool for and even if they don't know Japanese like it's still like an opportunity that is open uh he only speaks Spanish and English but his editor speaks Spanish very well so oh wow that's so cool okay that's that's really cool I had no idea what do you think about the uh the transition from traditional manga to digital that's kind of sad but I I understand why that change happened that's really cool what do you consider is the most satisfying part of of your job M oh it's like the next step um okay here's an interesting one what do you do when a manga artist is experiencing writers or art block oh yeah that's a good one I want to know I want to know that one I want to know that one it's it's a good question there's no answer Oh no just got to wait just got to be patient can't do anything do you have any advice for aspiring manga artists for wow that's perfect thank you this is actually really insightful and I think this will be like a huge inspiration for uh people who watch as well as for us as well that was my childhood dream but the idea of it is a little scary but I want to it's on my bucket one of the things I want to do before I die yeah feel like one oh maybe just one I you had to sacrifice a lot not the on hi awesome was in charge of these are all the mang wow I sometimes forget that like manga is is like smaller no no that's amazing it's it's cool seeing like the finished product of like everyone's hard work cuz I feel like a lot of people don't think about how many like people are involved from start to finish of like the publishing of a manga oh man the the inking and the uh the screen tones the screen tones oh man the screen tones well at least it's digital right is this one digital yeah I'm just surprised cuz sometimes like digital really does look traditional sometimes yeah it really does thank you cool okay we're back and we're going to go over what we're going to make changes to after we got uh the editor to uh make her comments and how did you feel about that experience by the way um I'm mostly glad about uh that she understood what I was jaring that was my main concern I was I was afraid she was going to be like what is this what's going that what's going there but she was just like oh is this a sea creature cat and I was like she was like is this a cat I was like yes is this doing this I was like yes so I'm happy that most she really liked your Shonen fight too I'm I'm happy cuz uh I I don't really do Shonen um actually I don't do manga at all so I don't know why I'm so anyway I'm want to talk about my changes here okay um mostly what the editor was saying at first I got scared because I when she said there's three separate story lines going on I was like no no way no no no no no no there's not no there's not but after I clarified it she understood that it was all one thing yeah she mostly got confused at the ending and I will say she made a really good point about um it looking like you're returning the cat to its rightful owners because I realized like your viewers and I know very well who s and fat guy are so I didn't even question their presence but I like trying to look at it from the lens of someone who like has no idea who any of these characters are it it does look like oh we got our cat back yeah I see that because she was like she was like who are these and I was like oh um that's his roommates and she's like how do I know that and I was like oh W I guess you don't cuz I you know so I'm going to change the ending is basically what I'm going to do and she did come up with an idea where it's like oh he since the cat is coming along with the ride Maybe can have the a parting ways or maybe the cat like starts following dius and he's like can I can I I like you now or something like that can I suggest an ending that I think would fun please please pleas so the change I would make to the ending that I think would be funny is if um like there's a panel where datus notices the cat is like like followed him yeah he's like stol on his leg Yeah like still yeah yeah still biting his leg and he's like wo what the hell and maybe he like he gets a cat off of him maybe he like looks at it and he thinks it looks cute again mhm he like it's kind of it's cute or one of those things where like the cat like slowly follows you but then when he looks back it stops and then when it when it walks again he falls again May yeah or maybe he tries pitting it again and then it ends with the panel of the cat like biting his hand it bites his hand and then he looks into the sunset or something if there is a sun in this world I I think it'd be funny if it ended with the cat like still being his op like the cat still hates him I think I do unfortunately have to get rud the you know my characters uh for now because for for readers who don't aren't familiar with my channel I feel like there are distraction to this story as a oneoff I think cuz I'm going for I think I'm going for a one shot kind of thing or just like a premise of the world I think I might have to cut send fat guy out and just do something with the cat at the end to make the story complete mhm and then later you get you maybe if I continue with the manga then you get to meet the two characters here I think that's what I'm going to do yeah or like what if you had him like RI like take the cat off of his um leg he like rips it off his leg and he holds it up like this and the cat is like and he's like a there's so many things I got to do there so many things you do with I think at the end of the day I just got to do something with this that end it with something with the had to do the cat I can't speak I think cat I think you should keep it a little  yeah yeah because I would like if I were to continue this manga I would like him as like a kind of like a pet that just like keeps biting him that'd be funny yeah like an ongoing joke but like he's nice to everyone else but he hates you cuz that's why I was kind of going for here cuz you know he's chilling he's nice but he only bites dius but yeah um and also what else I would change obviously I would change like the just the art entirely like climbing I just I changed it a little bit it looks good but I would make it better right I don't even I'm not even settled with the art style by the way this is just a rough I was just going quickly as possible again I would show that this uh shark is chasing him closer before he fart if you had two panels where the panel is dtis in this exact pose and the guy's like stopped dead in his tracks cuz he's like what are you doing yeah and then and then the next panel is the same exact pose except it's yeah I think I I need more uh what's the word like umph or something like anticipate not like more highlight what's the word more thrill it would make it more thrilling if I add like a couple more panels on this part is what I'm saying that's what I'm saying we're just adding to like the comedy Factor and and the comedy the bit Yeah I think everything else like I think I just have to change the the ending really right yeah I think yeah the main thing is the ending I think everything else is really solid and I would draw this like very good I spent a lot of work really liked this page spread yeah she was very happy about the double spread I I would draw this much better like like I need reference for this this would be like the money shot this is the money shot yeah yeah because you you go from you flip one you're like WAOW it's a Underwater World whatever world not not exactly underwater but yeah yeah anyways yeah that's my what you what you guys think what you guys what you guys think of my manga I think it's good just as I had feared it turns out like trying to describe a magic casting system with no words and just images was detrimental to my storytelling uh abilities but oh man I don't know what I don't know what to do okay so the points of criticism that I remember and she made a very good point she said that the way the magic casting panels are depicted it kind of looks like she summoned the spider oh and I can definitely see that like accidentally yeah so that and also like it isn't clear like why she's at this house cuz obviously in my head I'm like she's a monster exterminator with like such a specific job that you wouldn't be able to pick up from just looking at theage yeah because my idea was like I'm I'm not sure like if you're allowed to have signs with words on it because I would have put like which for higher or something like that that would explain a lot yeah I was thinking maybe but like is that allowed I don't know so this is my idea right here let me take some junk paper this is my idea so pretend this is like the book right I was thinking of having the first page maybe be like this would be the title page like kind of what you had and it would just be like like a witch for higher ad but like how oh has a title page yeah and then the description could be like monster exterminator blah blah blah blah oh but that's words though is that oh that's so hard so like cuz like that so this is what I thought about doing where it shows in the ad she looks very confident like I can do a good job and then the nextage fny like see that she is a bundle of nerves clearly like doesn't know what the hell she's doing no I like that a lot it's confusing because like you know how you can't have words and it's wordless yeah but like like is Welcome Matt is that word is that word a stop sign it's an item basically yeah like a stop sign I might ask about that just to see if this is POS because this would definitely add to the whole story I feel like because we don't know why she's at this house mhm and we don't know why she needs help right yeah so I thought it'd be creative if I had a title page Witch For Hire monster exterminator having monster problems call blah blah blah blah and she looks all like like perfect photo shoot and then the the opening page is just her being nervous nervous about her job I feel like this would add so much context but I don't know if it's cheating so I have to ask about that yeah we'll find out we'll find we'll to find out the other thing that I'm struggling with because okay the editor said that the ending was really strong like she really liked this page but I think the I really like that page too this is your best page me too I agree the joke is very funny but the part that's difficult is how the spider shows up like basically this entire sequence of magic casting is kind of confusing understandably so so okay so I was thinking the change I would make is the monster is no longer invisible or unseen maybe she just she has to like maybe she opens a closet and it's there and then she freaks out and that's when she starts using her magic to try and like attack it maybe or like okay as soon as she comes in the house is just there or no like the lady maybe she's pointing at a closet door like maybe she's saying like I got it Trapped in the Closet store door can you please help me and then there could be like a like a series of suspense panels where she's like going to reach for the doorknob mhm cuz she's she doesn't know like what she's going to be working with oh my that's a lot lot of change I know that's a lot of change I would have to make a lot of changes but I feel like that would be clearer like instead of cuz this looks kind of vague right with the lady like showing her the living room cuz that could mean anything but if you had her pointing specifically at a door then it's then it's more clear of like oh something's in there that she's scared of and that she's also scared of well this goes to show you that like keep your names messy because you're you might end up you might end up redrawing entire Pages cuz I really like this shot and I'd like to still use it somehow maybe I'll use it for like an attacking panel I do like how also the editor said like you should work on like a notebook where you could turn the page because when you put two pages together you don't want it to make it look too symmetrical yeah you have the right idea oh yeah yeah cuz what did she mention I did that by accident because I was actually nervous to because uh we got instructions to like use paper like print or paper and I was like oh I'm just going to I I was going to do it but I didn't want to redraw everything on here so like can I just use my notebook every time I'd seen um images of manga uh names or like names it was always on separate sheets of paper so I was like I guess I have to follow that but this ended up being like way better to show your like double page yeah I was surprised I thought I was going to get yelled at like why why you draw draw on A4 paper what the no I literally thought cuz it's a different it's technically the same size is smaller I think right oh another good point she made was that these top panels both kind of start similarly so it's a little repetitive oh so I'm like okay got it I like this one maybe this should be a completely different like angle or something right different a different attack pose yeah there's a lot of have to change also ink drops if you have any like ideas recommendations feel free to let us know um yeah cuz this is not due until February so we have a lot of time but uh in the next installment of this manga page series when we come back we will have our fully done sketches and we will be inking a page we'll ink a page just for you guys and then maybe the rest is off because you know it's a lot of work but we will be learning crotch hat cross-hatching what do you call it screen tones Well Screen tones screen tones is a big one a huge one actually cuz we don't know how to do that another one is just like learning inking techniques like cross-hatching would be really nice to to uh learn anyways just techniques oh and I forgot to mention don't assume that your submission has to be traditional it can be digital the only reason why why we're drawing these traditionally is because SPI in is a traditional Arts channel so I feel like it'd be kind of going against the theme of the channel if we were to do it digitally any if I were to actually make a manga I'm on that tablet I would not be doing it traditionally I half agree with that I I think I would do it digitally or maybe a mix of physical and then alter uh changing things on the digital tablet but the reason why we're doing traditional not only because of spild in Channel but the reason why is because the uh we went to the def note exhibit mhm M and the manga page it was it was just so beautiful cuz he knows that's the only manga page that exists yeah and that's what makes it special cuz it you're you're seeing a museum and it's it's just beautiful I need to find an image of it to send to the editors there's one page where like you can't tell from just a scan but there's a panel where the entire background is just collage right do you remember that it looked incredible and like you can see the brush Strokes you can see where they use correction tape and like correction you can see paper you can see paper where he puts on top of the the manga page to correct something like seeing those like imperfections yeah it got me excited inspired me it looks incredible but also I understand that like it just makes digital is way easier wayas way easier I agree you you did hear the uh the editor say that the digital Renaissance has saved the manga industry in a way and I was just I was surprised by that because probably like helped with manga Health as well I imagine especially stressful cuz you know they can control they don't have to redraw stuff over and over again like you know pros and cons are both it's just we really I think because of how much more difficult traditional manga is to make it makes it more like fascinating to look at but you know since we're doing a one shot we just thought that like that like uh it would be nice to have everything physical boom I did it yeah at least we did it right just to say we made manga Pages the traditional way yeah I just think it's interesting too yeah plus I've always wanted to tried like manga paper just out of curiosity it's going to be tough it's going to be tough yeah but you know after that digital All Digital baby but for this channel we'll do traditional all right well a reminder guys the contest when do it do Emily February 28th 2025 and uh again more details will be in the link in the description and the pinned comment so make sure you look at those rules carefully and yeah thank you so much to kokawa for having us participate and visit an editor and giving us like such a cool opportunity I'm very happy about that yeah they even showed us around the building and it was very interesting really nice building interesting damn really nice building so yeah mhm thanks to the patrons for making this possible too yeah thank you so much patrons um if you would also like to get early access to watching and commenting on our videos please check out our patreon in the description down below and yeah that's about it next time you see us we will be inking these pages and the mine will look very different so looking forward to that thanks so much ink drops we'll see you next time bye bye\"},\n",

You know, I was super\\nconfident with the lobster, but I was wrong. I didn\\'t want to make\\nthat same mistake again. - So it\\'s a meat\\nand potatoes burger. I used white cheddar and bacon. I love bacon. Who doesn\\'t? - It really is\\nmeat and potatoes. I think it\\'s clever,\\nit\\'s simple, it\\'s cool. But it\\'s just a bit\\none dimensional for me. - It just needs a lift.

Whoo! - Um, can I just see\\nthe other beef burger? - Yes, Chef. - Thank you.\\nDescribe that for me please. - So I put bacon on the top, and I wanted sweetness,\\nacidity.

I love the flavor of the\\nbacon with the meat right off the bat. - This is delicious.\\n- This was a winner. - Thank you. - Thank you, Chef.\\n- Back in line, please. - Why didn\\'t I stick up\\nfor myself like I normally do?

I\\'m just so mad at myself\\nbecause I always-- It fucking hurts me. Like, I know what\\nI\\'m fucking doing, and, like, to know that-- - Why didn\\'t you\\nput that up there then? - Because I didn\\'t want\\nto do what I did yesterday. This has more attention\\nto detail, and I\\'m only just missing legs. - No legs.\\n- No legs, Chef. - Unfortunately,\\nyour dish is out. - I want to learn\\nwhen to step back. I didn\\'t doubt it. I knew it. I told her I was 100% confident\\nin my shit.

       "  'transcript': \"Having a big audience for you. Must be a cool thing.\\nGood for you. I'm excited. Good for you. You made it. Let's see how. Cause\\nyou know. Fingers crossed. Welcome back everyone it's Charlie, Marvel just revealed\\nChris Evans is finishing a new contract to return again in Avengers\\nfive doomsday, this time as another new character. He won't be his original Captain America\\nSteve Rogers from the main MCU. He won't be his Johnny Storm from Fantastic Four. Like we just saw during Deadpool and Wolverine. part of his new character is also tied to Robert Downey\\nJr's Doctor Doom in their borrowing a story concept from what looks like Avengers Forever,\\na comic book in the Kang storyline. that they would have been using when the Council of Kings was going to be the new main villain\\nand they were still doing Avengers five is King Dynasty. so we'll break it all down because it also pays off. Another twist from the Captain America comics\\nthat everyone was talking about several years ago, especially during Avengers Endgame\\nwhen they had the big Hail Hydra moment. that Easter egg from endgame was actually based on the recent Secret\\nEmpire Captain America comics. Not to be confused with Secret Invasion. nobody. Nobody wants to remember a secret invasion. So it also involves the original Avengers actors\\ncoming back to even the ones who died. So we'll break it all down. If you're brand new to the channel\\nbe sure to subscribe to get all the videos. The reason why they're announcing so many big Avengers,\\nfive doomsday things right now is because we're getting ready to start production\\nearly next year, and they have to finish all the contracts for all these other big actors that are coming back,\\nlike Chris Evans, for instance, in The other Avengers. but if you didn't see the news. Yesterday, while I was busy doing a video for Ryan\\nReynolds and Andrew Garfield talking about the future of Deadpool and Spider-Man, the MCU, literally,\\nlike while I was finishing that video, Marvel also revealed that they're bringing Chris Evans back again\\nas another different character for Avengers five. Now, he might also be signing a contract\\nto come back for Avengers six Secret Wars. Most of the news was just focusing on Avengers\\nfive, though. part of the idea is that the plot for Avengers five\\nwill be very different from the plot for Avengers six. It'll be a little bit like Avengers Infinity War\\nand Avengers Endgame, where technically it's like one giant story divided into two parts\\nthat they just released in back to back years. but when I say Chris Evans\\nnew character is an Easter egg for Avengers Forever in the Secret Empire comics from Captain\\nAmerica is basically an evil version of Captain America. Secret Empire was Hydra Captain America, who was a\\ndifferent spin from Avengers Forever Evil Captain America. But for the purpose of these movies like Avengers five,\\nyou just consider him an evil version of Captain America. Steve Rogers. same basic type of twist,\\nlike what if Steve Rogers Captain America were evil instead of the most noble character\\nyou could possibly imagine in the MCU? The way they explain him, he's\\nmeant to be the soul of the Avengers. what if he showed up? But he was a very, very evil version of that. part of the idea is the Chris\\nEvans is supposed to be returning in Avengers five with Robert Downey\\nJr in the other original six Avengers characters. But here's the thing. Some of them will be coming back as part of an evil Avengers team controlled by Robert Downey\\nJr as Doctor Doom from the multiverse. Like he'll be controlling his own evil Avengers team\\nthat will just absolutely wipe the new MCU Avengers. So you got to see the parallels\\nhere, like the twist that they're going for on screen, the reactions they're looking for from the audience, like,\\noh, it's all our heroes. All our friends are back that we thought were either dead\\nor retired, like Old Man Cap. you imagine how they're going to react when they see\\nRobert Downey Jr. Doctor doom face. And it looks just like their friend\\nwho sacrificed himself in endgame, but then he just proceeds to absolutely destroy\\nall them and completely wipe the MCU. another good example of this is Black\\nWidow is supposed to come back in the movie too. Like just they've been announced Chris Evans all of them are supposed to come back\\nin different ways as different versions of the characters. With a couple exceptions, like Thor, for instance, he's\\nstill very much alive in the MCU. They didn't say what the exact roster of this evil\\nDoctor Doom Avengers team is going to be because Thor, for instance,\\nis still going to be with that new Avengers team. end, I don't think it would make sense\\nto just have him fight another evil version of himself from another universe\\nlike that, be a little bit redundant. good comp for him from another universe\\nwould be a version of Hercules. Like another God level character who could fight him. They didn't say who was going to be, though. Like,\\nthey didn't say it was going to be Hercules. It could be any number of characters. Just imagine someone who's way\\nstronger in more powerful than Thor from another universe. Robert Downey Jr Doctor Doom is meant to show up in\\nthe MCU, just controlling a more powerful Avengers team. Some of them will look exactly like the Avengers who died\\nduring endgame, Infinity War, or either retired,\\nand we haven't seen them since then. but the whole twist here with Chris Evans\\ncoming back as evil Captain America is meant to pay off the hill\\nhydrazine from Avengers Endgame, which itself was meant to be an Easter egg for the Secret Empire comics,\\nwhich were pretty recent. it was actually pretty controversial. Like people freaked out\\nwhen they had the Hail Hydra moment with Captain America. that storyline was very different from Avengers Forever. In Avengers Forever, it was just a version of Kang\\nwho controlled his own evil Avengers from across time. So like I said, they were originally going\\nto do a version of this during Avengers five, when it was still Qing dynasty in the Council of Kings\\nwould just have their own Avengers team. They would pull together from different realities\\nacross time. Now they're just making that Doctor Doom\\nbeing the one to control everything, because they basically swapped him in to the plot. A lot of it is similar\\nto what they were doing with Qing dynasty, with the exception of the Council of Kings\\nbeing really huge characters. I believe they're still going to pay off that storyline. Maybe Robert Downey Jr's Doctor Doom and his Avengers will just absolutely wipe\\nthe Council of Kings before they show up. Kind of like Thanos wiped the Asgardians\\nand Loki at the beginning of Infinity War. opening five minutes of the movie R.I.P.\\nCouncil of Kang's. Secret Empire was a version of Captain America\\nwho was from an alternate reality created by the Cosmic Cube,\\nwhere he grew up as Hydra. Then he tried to take over the main Marvel reality. we also know from the Russos at Comic-Con that Avengers\\nfive is also meant to adapt some of the plot of Time Runs Out, which is the more recent version of Secret Wars,\\nwith Robert Downey Jr's Doctor Doom doing a similar type of mission that he did\\nduring that storyline, trying to save the multiverse like he is thinking that he's a good character, trying to protect the multiverse,\\nbut by destroying other universes to do it. Because one of the big twist of that comic book storyline\\nis that in order to try and save the main Marvel Universe,\\nthey had to sacrifice other universes. I believe he's supposed to appear in live action\\nfor the first time at the end of that new Fantastic Four movie\\nnext summer that takes place in another universe. That team we know is going to survive. Come to the MCU for Avengers five. So like the brand new Fantastic Four team will be in\\nAvengers five, I think that he just comes to the MCU at some point along with them to not the same time,\\nbut is also survives to come to the MCU. and I believe the whole point here in bringing back\\nthe original Avengers, actors from Infinity War, endgame, the whole Infinity Saga is so that they can basically\\njust absolutely wipe the floor with the new Avengers team. Like,\\nthere's been all this talk since after Avengers Endgame, Marvel Phase four, everything that Marvel has done\\nsince then, how they haven't done a good job of setting up brand new characters who are just not viable\\nsuccessors to the original Avengers. Like the original Avengers. Just seem way more badass than all the new characters\\nwho could potentially replace them on the Avengers team. so the basically getting kind of meta with that idea\\nduring Avengers five, where those original Avengers show up as different versions of characters,\\nbut completely destroy the New Avengers. so you imagine Chris Evans evil Captain America\\nabsolutely trashing Anthony Mackie's new Captain America. the whole idea with Avengers five, though, is\\nthey're ending things kind of like they did with Avengers Infinity War. Like Robert Downey\\nJr's Doctor Doom is meant to win. At the end of Avengers five, the multiverse collapses\\nthe rest of the way it did at the end of time runs out downer ending like Thanos,\\nthe infinity Gantlet snap at the end of infinity War leading into Avengers Endgame,\\nbut this time leading into Secret Wars within, creating a version of Battle World\\nand becoming God. Emperor Doom That was why they had the Easter egg\\nfor that comic book run during Deadpool and Wolverine. Just to remind you that, oh yeah,\\nwe're going to be doing a version of this pretty soon. then. That's how they explain them bringing back other X-Men\\nFantastic Four legacy characters like Tobey Maguire, Spider-Man,\\nAndrew Garfield, Spider-Man, so on and so forth. Nicolas Cage's Ghost Rider was supposed to come back\\nduring Deadpool and Wolverine. Ryan Reynolds said that he tried really hard\\nto get him to come back. I believe we will see some Ghost Rider\\nby the time we get to Secret Wars, though. Robert Downey Jr. God Emperor doom rules over that single world\\nfor the entire multiverse, also paying off the line from Avengers Age of Ultron because all the movies\\nare meant to comp the previous movies to, He covers the world in a suit of armor to protect it. But it's very twisted reality, very dystopian. It looks a lot like Secret Wars in the comics. if you haven't read that comic book run,\\nbasically in the movie version of that, it sounds like they're doing, they assemble a multiverse\\nAvengers team of all these other different surviving characters from other realities\\nlike the X-Men, Fantastic Four. All these are the legacy actors that are coming back to make a more powerful version\\nof The Avengers team to stop him in Save the Multiverse. then the way that Marvel has been talking about it. Kevin Feige they use that as a way to soft reboot the MCU. So like when they remake the multiverse,\\nthey remake the MCU to more closely resemble the comic book 616 universe\\nwhere all the different characters X-Men, Fantastic Four, Avengers have always existed together,\\nand nobody thinks that it's weird. So there's no big continuity issues going forward. the funny thing about this,\\nif you watch Crisis on Infinite Earths in the Arrowverse, a couple years ago,\\nI did a whole bunch of videos about it. I'll link them in the description below. but if you remember what they did after the end of Crisis\\non Infinite Earths, how they retuned the continuity in some of the characters came back,\\nbut they were a little bit different. Cisco actually talked about this. That's kind of what Marvel is going to do with the MCU after Secret Wars, where like some things are different,\\nbut some things look the same. this is also how Marvel recast\\nsome characters that they want to recast to. Like they make the changes they want to make,\\nbut they keep the actors that they want to keep. but that's how Deadpool comes permanently to the MCU. Like Hugh Jackman's\\nWolverine comes to the MCU. For instance. and you have a whole bunch of new X-Men characters\\npopping up that they turn into that new X-Men team in a brand new X-Men\\nreboot movie. There's also a lot of Avengers\\nrelated storyline in the MCU happening going into Avengers five,\\nso you remember we had the Thunderbolts movie coming in. The whole twist of that movie\\nis that Val basically turns them into the Dark Avengers, but she just calls them the New Avengers\\nthe same way they did with John Walker. When the military turned him into Captain America\\nand gave him the shield. basically, it's Val stealing the thunder\\nto make more thunderbolts puns from the actual New Avengers who are surviving from Avengers Endgame, and the\\nnew characters that will join that new Avengers roster. so we might have a situation where there's like\\nthree different Avengers teams fighting in Avengers five, both the new Avengers\\nteams inside the MCU and Robert Downey Jr, Doctor Doom's evil Avengers team\\nshowing up from the multiverse. Either way, I think the idea is that Doctor\\nDoom's Avengers team just completely wipes all the other Avengers teams like it doesn't matter\\nhow many Avengers show up, they will completely destroy all them. they're going to be announcing more casting news\\nfor Avengers, five more characters and everything the next couple months as they get ready to film. So I'll do more videos as they start to reveal more\\ndetails about what's actually going on during the film. everybody post all your reactions in the comments below. What do you think about Chris Evans coming back again? But this time is evil Captain America. there's a bunch of other stuff going on this week. My Skeleton Crew episode three video will post next DC's\\nCreature Commandos Episode three video posting after that, Henry Cavill also made a bunch of big announcements\\nabout his Warhammer TV series, so I'll do a video for that later this week to be sure to enable alerts for my channel\\nso you don't miss any of that stuff. Click here for Ryan Reynolds and Andrew Garfield talking about Deadpool four\\nand the future of his Spider-Man character And click here for my Robert Downey\\nJr Doctor Doom teaser from Comic-Con Thank you so much for watching,\\nand I'll see you guys in the next one!\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': \"(upbeat music) - [Narrator] Did you know that your F-150 can be equipped with an available feature called Ford BlueCruise\\nhands-free highway driving? This technology adds\\nhands-free highway driving when using available intelligent\\nAdaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane Centering, and Speed Sign Recognition. Ford BlueCruise is available\\non specific sections of divided highways called\\nHands-Free Blue Zones that make up over 100,000\\nmiles of North American roads. Here's how it works. (upbeat music) Ford BlueCruise allows you to take your hands off the steering wheel while the system accelerates, brakes, and steers your F-150 within the lane. It uses advanced infrared\\ndriver-facing cameras that are located on the A-pillar\\nand above the SYNC screen to track eye gaze and head position to ensure that you're\\npaying attention to the road while in Hands-Free mode, as well as hands-on Lane Centering mode, which works on most roads\\nwith visible lane lines. A few things need to happen\\nbefore it can be activated. Ford BlueCruise must be enabled, Adaptive Cruise Control must be turned on, the system must be able to\\ndetect both lane markings, your hands must initially\\nbe on the steering wheel, and your eyes need to be\\nfocused on the road ahead at all times. To enable Ford BlueCruise, go to Features, press Driver Assistance, press Cruise Control,\\nthen press Lane Centering. To turn Ford BlueCruise and\\nAdaptive Cruise Control on, use this button on the steering wheel. Press the plus and minus\\nbuttons to adjust your speed. If you wish, this button can\\nbe used to select the gap between your vehicle and\\nthe vehicle ahead of you. Once the system is on, the\\ncolor of this indicator changes to let you know the status. Blue means that Ford BlueCruise is on and your in Hands-Free mode. If the system determines that you are not looking at the road, you will either get a message displayed in the instrument cluster, or you may also hear a chime to remind you to return your eyes to the road. The warning you will get depends on where the vehicle determines\\nyour eyes are looking. If you do not react to the warnings, Ford BlueCruise cancels, quickly activates and releases the brakes, and slows your vehicle down while maintaining steering control. (upbeat music) On roadways where hands-free\\ndriving is not permitted, the system can still accelerate, brake, and steer the vehicle in the lane if the driver hands are on the wheel and if both lane markings can be detected with Lane Centering mode. When this indicator is green, that means that Ford BlueCruise is active for hands-on driving. When this is present, you must keep your hands\\non the steering wheel. If you need to return\\nyour attention to the road or resume control of the vehicle, a prompt in the instrument\\ncluster will notify you. To turn Ford BlueCruise off, press either the cancel/resume button or the Adaptive Cruise Control button or switch your vehicle off. Keep in mind, some external conditions may cancel Ford BlueCruise. For example, if lane\\nmarkings are not available or not visible by the vehicle's camera or the lane becomes too narrow. If this occurs while your\\nhands are on the steering wheel and your eyes are on the\\nroad, a tone will sound and a message will appear in the instrument cluster alerting you that Ford BlueCruise has been canceled. However, if this occurs while\\nyou're not focused on the road and your hands are not\\non the steering wheel, the system will display a message and a tone will sound\\nuntil you resume control. If you do not resume control in time, Ford BlueCruise quickly\\nactivates and releases the brakes and slows your vehicle down while maintaining steering control. When you take control and again, a message will prompt you to\\npress the accelerator pedal to allow the system to resume. Keep in mind that heavy\\nrainstorms, snowstorms, or fog may make it difficult for\\nthe system to operate, especially if the camera or\\nother sensors are blocked or if lighting or visibility is poor.

       "  'transcript': \"(upbeat music) - [Narrator] Automatic transmission. The automatic transmission available on the FJ Cruiser gives the\\ndriver a range of choices. Shifting the lever to D for\\ndrive will accommodate most on road driving needs. To slow the vehicle when\\ndescending a steep grade, the driver can shift the transmission into fourth gear by pushing\\nthe lever to the left. If more engine braking is needed, the lever can be pulled\\nback into third gear. To switch from third gear to second, push the lever to the right and down, then to the right for low or first gear. On FJ Cruisers with four-wheel drive, it's best to leave the smaller\\nlever in the H2 position, that's high speed two-wheel\\ndrive for most on road driving. When the vehicle loses\\npower due to wheel slipping, the driver can shift into high speed, four wheel drive or H4 without stopping. Begin by slowing down to\\nless than 50 miles per hour, then pull the smaller lever\\nback into the H4 position, a four-wheel drive icon will appear in the instrument cluster. When off-roading in rugged\\nterrain, sand or mud, the driver can select low\\nspeed four-wheel drive or L4. To engage low speed four-wheel drive, stop the vehicle and depress the brake, put the automatic\\ntransmission into neutral, shift the smaller lever\\npast neutral to L4, the VSC off indicator will light up, then put the automatic\\ntransmission back into drive. To return to high four-wheel\\ndrive or two-wheel drive, stop the vehicle and\\nfollow the same process. Note, a vehicle should be driven in four-wheel drive for at\\nleast 10 miles each month to keep all the components lubricated. If your vehicle doesn't shift as expected, refer to the owner's manual.\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': '(light music) - [Narrator] Your Bronco\\nSport is built to handle your adventures. Let me show you. The controls on your center console will help customize your\\noff-road experiences. First, let\\'s talk about G.O.A.T. Modes, which stands for \"goes\\nover any type of terrain.\" Turn the G.O.A.T. Modes dial\\nleft or right to switch modes. Normal Mode is for everyday driving, and provides a balance\\nof excitement, comfort, and convenience. Next up Eco Mode is designed\\nto help reduce fuel consumption and deliver maximum efficiency. For a sporty steering\\nfield choose Sport Mode. You\\'ll experience increased\\naccelerator pedal response as the powertrain system pulls\\nonto the lower gears longer helping your vehicle accelerate faster. Slippery Mode helps make your\\nBronco Sport easier to control on slippery surfaces, like\\nice and snow covered roads. Traction and stability\\ncontrols are more restrictive in this mode for better\\nhandling and control. Mud/Ruts Mode is only\\nfor off-road driving. This mode gives you the optimum experience when traversing muddy,\\nrutted, or uneven terrains. The traction and stability\\ncontrols are less restrictive to allow more tire spin and\\nclear mud from the tires. Sand Mode is also for off-road use only. Use this for fun driving\\nin soft, dry sand. Rock Crawl Mode is for\\noff-road use at very low speed, when navigating aggressive uneven terrain that may include large rocks. Back to the center console. This button turns on\\nfour wheel drive lock. Turning this on increases\\nfour wheel drive performance by preventing the front and\\nrear axles from disconnecting. Certain G.O.A.T. Modes will engage four wheel drive lock automatically. This button turns on the Rear\\nDifferential Lock feature, which provides additional\\ntraction when driving over aggressive terrain, or in case your Bronco Sport gets stuck. Rear Differential Lock\\nwill engage automatically in certain drive modes. Now let\\'s talk about the\\ntraction control system, which turns on automatically each time you start your vehicle. If your Bronco Sport\\nexperiences excessive wheel spin and a loss of traction, the traction control\\nsystem applies the brakes to individual wheels, and when needed, simultaneously reduces engine power. This will result in the\\nvehicle accelerating through slippery or loose surfaces. You can press this button if\\nyou prefer to limit traction and stability control interference. You may need to do so when\\nnavigating a steep incline so that your vehicle has\\nthe necessary engine power. And finally, this button\\nis for trail control, which is for off-road\\ndriving at low speed. This system automatically\\ncontrols engine torque and vehicle braking to\\nmaintain a vehicle speed that you select so that\\nyou can focus on steering. It\\'s like cruise control\\nfor off-road driving. You can set your speed between\\none and 20 miles per hour when moving forward, and one to six miles per hour in reverse. Use the controls on your steering wheel to set your preferred speeds. Any questions? Go to Owner.Ford.com.'},\n",

The bowl is 12 gallons and is one of the largest I have ever made! I added fire cherry shrimp, they have a super deep red coloration and are a great beginner shrimp. \\n\\nNo filter aquariums are an easy fish tank setup for a beginner. They need almost no maintenance other than trimming the plants and feeding. Shrimp need a little additional food in addition to the plant matter and algae that grows in the tank. Avoid overfeeding as without a filter ammonia and nitrites can build up quickly!\\n\\nIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions, leave them down in the comments!

       "  'transcript': 'Driving is a great way to explore the magic\\xa0\\nof Scotland at your own pace. Stopping to say\\xa0\"ooh\" and \"ahh\" whenever you feel like it,\\nwithin\\xa0reason of course. Here\\'s a quick guide to the\\xa0rules, as well as a few tips to help\\nyou make\\xa0the most of your trip.  First things first, we drive on the left.\\xa0\\xa0 If you\\'re bringing your own\\xa0car, great. You\\'ll have an extra level of freedom. Don\\'t forget to bring your registration and\\xa0\\nownership documents, proof of insurance.\\xa0\\xa0 You must have at least third party insurance\\xa0cover... and some well-chosen music that will\\xa0\\xa0forever remind you of this trip. The playlist\\xa0part isn\\'t a legal requirement, but it should\\xa0be. Any valid EU driving licence works for us,\\xa0\\nand if yours is from outside the EU... you can drive in Scotland for up to a year. But not\\xa0in one go, obviously. Unless you\\'re a machine. Speed limits are usually signposted and the\\xa0\\nsigns are always in miles per hour. If you don\\'t see signs you can assume that on motorways\\xa0\\nand dual carriageways they are 70 miles per hour... for cars, coaches and minibuses and 60 miles\\xa0\\nper hour for caravans and lorries. There are speed cameras nearly everywhere to help enforce\\xa0the rules. In built-up areas, the speed limit is usually 30 miles per hour... and sometimes 20 miles\\xa0per hour near schools and town centers. Outside built-up areas, it\\'s 60 miles per hour for cars\\xa0\\nand 50 miles per hour for bigger vehicles. Top tip... there are no toll fees on Scottish roads or bridges. City petrol stations are often open 24\\xa0\\xa0hours a day. They\\'re self-service and sell unleaded\\xa0petrol and diesel by the litre. In more rural areas... you can drive for a long time without seeing one... so top-up whenever you get a chance. Most petrol\\xa0stations also have toilets... but Scotland has plenty\\xa0of good public facilities everywhere. We have very tough rules about driving under the influence\\xa0of alcohol and drugs. We\\'re even more strict than the rest of the UK... and there are heavy\\xa0penalties if you have more than 50 milligrams\\nof alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Don\\'t\\xa0risk it. We\\'re also pretty keen on politeness. You should always stop if you see somebody hoping\\xa0\\nto cross the road at a zebra crossing. Some roads, especially rural ones only have one lane... but they\\xa0all have regular passing places. If two cars are approaching each other on one of these roads... the\\xa0driver who flashes their lights first is the one\\xa0offering to wait. Everyone, apart from those who\\xa0\\nare having a really bad day, says thank you...\\xa0\\xa0 with a wave or a flash of the lights in the dark. Top tip, if you\\'ve pulled over on a narrow country road\\xa0in the dark... to allow the oncoming car to pass,\\nother drivers really appreciate it if you switch\\xa0\\xa0 from headlights to side lights, to help them see\\xa0better. We love roundabouts here, love them. Turn left onto roundabouts and give way to vehicles\\xa0on your right. Everyone in the car must wear a\\xa0seatbelt... and children must normally use a child\\xa0seat\\nuntil they\\'re 12 years old or 175 centimetres\\xa0tall. Whichever comes first. Car hire companies\\xa0usually provide these... and whilst it\\'s tempting to\\xa0tell the world about our beautiful scenery... it\\'s\\xa0illegal to use a handheld phone while driving. Top tip... roads are usually busier in towns and\\xa0cities\\nduring rush hour 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. and\\xa0\\xa04 to 6:30 p.m. In rural areas you will often\\xa0see animals on or beside the roads... their regard for the highway code needs work,\\nso\\xa0you have to be patient with them. Watch out in particular for pheasants. Those birds are\\xa0very pretty, but they are famously stupid\\xa0when it comes to traffic. Have a wonderful trip, a smooth drive and happy, happy memories.'},\n",

       "  'transcript': 'Maui, is the second-largest island in Hawaii, but fewer than 150,000 people call it home and you can drive from one side of the island\\nto the other in less than three hours. Many say that Maui is Hawaii\\'s most beautiful\\nisland and when you tour around you soon see why. In this North Pacific island paradise Polynesian\\nheritage and the modern American lifestyle go hand\\nin hand. Book a helicopter ride to get a birds-eye\\nview of this lush landscape that sprouted up from\\nthe fertile lava soil. People call this \"the Valley Isle\" because most of Maui sits in a bowl between the East and West Maui volcanoes that\\nshaped the island. Thanks to the tropical climate, and more than 80 beaches, you can enjoy watersports all around the sunny\\nisland. When the trade winds pick up, there are plenty of bars, shops, galleries\\nand museums to keep you entertained. Maui\\'s capital city, Wailuku, combines history\\nwith soul. Rent a car to enjoy the famous drive to Hana, which can be a return trip or the start of a spectacular journey around\\nthe island. The winding road will take you past some of\\nMaui\\'s most striking natural wonders. Stretch your legs at a waterfall and pick\\nup a Hawaiian treat along the way. Cast a line and see surfers compete to steal\\nthe show at the Ho\\'Okipa Beach Park. Spend an hour in the Garden of Eden Arboretum, a bamboo forest with great vistas. On the other side of Hana is the Haleakala\\nNational Park, with the highest peak of the island. It is a hotspot for hiking, so put on your all-weather gear and follow the trails past impressive cinder\\ncones. To avoid the steep climb, drive straight to the lookout to enjoy the\\nviews. The dormant volcano slopes down to the sunny\\nbeaches on the west coast of Maui. Big Beach, in Makena Beach State Park, is the perfect spot to try wake boarding. At sunset, the Molokini Island Preserve is painted dark against the evening sky, and when the sun comes out the water surrounding\\nit is amazingly clear. Book a boat tour and dive in to spot Hawaii\\'s\\ngreen turtles, feeding on the coral of Molokini Reef. You can also see these gentle marine creatures\\nfrom Maui\\'s shore at Turtle Town, as Maluaka Beach is often\\ncalled, or find a spot in the shade to enjoy the afternoon. Enjoy a resort stay with the family at nearby\\nWailea Beach or continue north to Kihei to learn how to\\nsurf. The oceanfront town has affordable accommodation,\\nshops and food, so it is an ideal place to stop for a few\\ndays. One of the prettiest towns in Maui is Lahaina\\nin the northwest. This historic center is bustling year-round and attracts whale watchers in winter. Visit galleries and museums or shop for souvenirs under the shade of an ancient banyan tree. There is no better place to end your tour\\nof Maui than Kaanpali Beach. This high-end beach resort combines everything\\nMaui has to offer. Sunshine, comfort, magnificent beaches and\\nculture, this lush island retreat has it all. So take the plunge.... splash out... and set\\nout to explore Maui!'},\n",

       "  'transcript': \"everybody loves a birthday party and they absolutely positively never ever go wrong except for all those times when they totally do weirdly a lot of those times happen to be in video games it's like video game characters can't age a year without the occasion needing to be marked by a sad depressing or unnecessarily violent celebration hey at least there's a cake here are seven video game birthday parties you might want to give a Miss no matter how many balloons there are on the invitation how old are you today 10 no I think you're nine I'm 10 nine 10 9 10 Nicole Pierce probably thought the 10th birthday party for her son Jackson had gone pretty well sure the kid has barely spoken since witnessing the death of his sister a year ago but otherwise I mean the cake looks delicious but then Jackson's phone hacking Motel dwelling burnout Uncle Aiden Pierce turns up so late that everyone else has already gone home that'll be the aan Pierce whose criminal infos SEC Antics were directly responsible for his niece's death and does he have a present well there's shiny wrapping paper on the stick of gum he just found in his pocket let's not argue semantics and if that wasn't bad enough he's only been there a couple of minutes when Nicole receives a threatening phone call and Uncle Aiden Sprints off to violently murder the perpetrator probably running over a bunch of civilians while he texts and drives you're going after that creep aren't you well you're doing it right now I can't believe you it's not like that I already know what Jackson's asking for for his 11th birthday a restraining order happy birthday happy birthday can you believe it he is growing up so fast happy happy birthday pal I can't believe you're already 10 when you're pinging out invitations to your 10th birthday party and you're huddling in a sealed Vault with the last remnants of human society your options are limited so you sort of have to invite the other nine and 10y olds even if the majority of them are jerk bullies who will try and extort your birthday presents from you mere moments after you've received them and start a fight if you don't hand over the good stuff you have just given me the sweet everything's fine I hope Butch what do you think you're doing leave him alone this would all be less of a downer were it not for the fact that the Mr handy robot called Andy completely obliterates your birthday Cape with a circular sore way to go literally Iron Chef still it's not a complete bust Andy the Mr handy went onto a brief but glittering career as the vaults doctor when your dad James escaped to the Wasteland remind me not to get any injuries that require surgery or any that don't require surgery for that matter it's my birthday I first rolled off the assembly line 7 years ago do me a favor and hand out these invites for my stellar Birthday Bash will you and quickly we're going to start any minute as clap trap's trusty minion it's up to you to arrange the celebrations in Borderlands 2 for his seventh birthday fabrication date anniversary whatever that involves you running around Sanctuary hand delivering party invitations to clap trap's three other friends and barely hanging around to listen to their feeble excuses Clapp is having a shind dig you know I'd go but I ain't going to but the lukewarm reaction doesn't stop clap trap ordering pizza and sparkling wigglers wherever they are or throwing some sweet shapes on the dance floor as he waits for more guests to arrive is it still called doing the robot if you are a robot long story short here lack of respiratory system means he can't even enjoy the party horns he's bought no one other than you turns up it all gets pretty awkward and there's so much left over Pizza you get a mission objective to take some home with you and yet clap trap doesn't seem too disappointed that was the best party I've ever thrown does that make it worse I think that makes it worse we're sending you down to the other end of the state 47 the target's a gangster by the name of Vinnie sinistra the mission a new life in Hitman blood Money has Agent 47 infiltrating the birthday party of a former Cuban drug Lord's youngest child the place is crawling with Secret Service agents so 47 is going to have to find a thematically appropriate disguise from the many options available to subtly Infiltrate The oh who am I kidding we all know which disguise he's going to pick judging by the crib the youngest child is still a baby which is good because then it probably won't remember the more than usually Psychopathic clown that shot the dog detonated the barbecue got drunk with its mother well cheers to you goofy fed the garbage disposal guy into his garbage truck and shot his father in the face with his own ludicrously oversized hand Cannon what the hell and the worst part after all that organization of catering and murderous children's entertainment the baby doesn't even show up to his own party no matter how long you hang around in great Batman was supposed to be hey I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner officer uh Owens but there's a guy smoking over there in the corner Booth wait here I'll have a word you have to feel for Gotham resident Noel in Batman Arkham Knight no one should have to celebrate their birthday alone but there Noel is sitting in the rather Grim surroundings of Paul's Diner with a tiny cupcake and a single candle to Mark the occasion what's worse is his birthday is clearly on the 31st of October so it probably gets hijacked by Halloween parties every single year though you can bet the costumes in Gotham City are on point things only get worse for Noel on his special day the antisocial guy in the booth next to him releases a load of scarecrow's fear toxin causing him and his fellow patrons to and I quote tear each other to Pieces people for one minute were quietly enjoying their meals suddenly became embroiled in a nightmarish and Savage attack I don't even think he had time to eat the cupcake that's how tragic this situation is still kudos to n for overcoming his unfortunate death and Landing a kushy game design job at Rock Steady Studios wait a minute surprise what is all this it's your birthday Kenzie so you've never been to a birthday party no oh like not even growing up I went to the school of the America since kindergarten we know the Third Street Saints know how to throw a party so Kinsey's birthday celebrations in G out of hell should have been a cinch just throw another Montel Jordan Dance Off obviously if it a't ain't broke and it definitely ain't then don't try to fix it yet what we get is a modest gathering with Jane Austin pin the tail on the donkey and a cake made by an alien which I'd check just in case it contains any ingredients that are fatally poisonous to carbon-based life forms oh and board games by which I mean a Ouija board that once belonged to real life weird occultist alist Crowley I can't see how this could possibly go wrong oh wait the board is haunted by a malevolent spirit safe to say we've never attended a party so bad it ends with someone get suck through a hell portal though we have gone to a few parties where the bathroom ended up looking like one with the party officially over the whole thing descends into a heated debate over who's going to follow the president into hell and rescue them I'm coming too are you kidding me how do you plan to come back I try not to sweat the details you need someone with you that does no it's my birthday fine still fewer arguments than if they' played Monopoly instead what happened I don't know drank a bit left the hospital broke a few windows before I sign you out everybody walked away from this in one piece right sure yeah everybody's fine hospitals seem better days though when you're a genetically engineered Krogan super soldier who was grown in a vat you don't really have a birthday as such which is probably why grunt from Mass Effect goes so hard on his first ever a birthday night out first his men try to break him out of the hospital he's in by having him climb down a rope doesn't work out that well then they all took a bunch of totally respectful pictures on the Krogan Memorial in the presidium set fire to a police car then stole the police car while it was on fire the seek guys jumped out then I figured they didn't want it so I took it CC are armed with Riot foam though so it should just be a matter of time before this part is well and truly over right wrong sprayed us down with Riot foam didn't work so well on me and why is that cuz I was on fire you know from the car come on Shepherd keep up good thing grunt has Commander Shepherd in his life to set a good example and make sure that he knows what he did is wrong and that he needs to make amends for all the trouble he's caused officer this Krogan is part of a secret Spectre task force operation fire Cobra claw operation fire Cobra claw that's right I can take it from here you two as bad as each other I love you grant those were the video game birthday bashes we wish we declined on Facebook got a disastrous Birthday Bash we missed off the list drop it in the comments and like And subscribe for more videos like this from outside Xbox see you next time do you know what the best present you could get us here at outside

should get stronger passwords what else does it say it also says you've been playing Watchdogs all right yes I have been playing Watchdogs and you'd think if my life followed any of the rules of the

mobile and endlessly trolling people with traffic ballards LOL I've been hoist with my own patard that's Shakespeare info made a tit of myself supposed to have five still at least Watch Dogs is shaping up well my biggest concern was that it wouldn't sell the fancy of being able to control an entire city from your phone but just the act of flitting between cameras to plan your next move makes this very different from your average cover shooter and that's before you get into the later abilities on the skill tree which allow you to temporarily disable helicopters or plunge an entire city block Into Darkness if you aren't already on an NSA watch list buying this game will guarantee you a spot I didn't know in terms of the single player story Aiden Pierce himself seems like a bit of a Dullard in the Connor Kenway mold but fortunately his mate Jordi chin which we're pretty sure is a finishing move in the northeast of England makes up for it that is a terrible plan I love it

shotgun but mainly a smartphone the hacker fantasy extends to the multiplayer to if your console's online by default it's open to being invaded by other players in a smart touch the invading player is actually penalized for killing you so it's nowhere near as trolly as it could be but we're still anticipating some hilarious griefing you could switch the mode off but where's the fun in that yeah that's the way to do it the rest of the time the whole of Chicago is your playground and you're free to Revel in its City Center architecture its leafy suburbs and the fact that some lunatic Town planner decided to put centrally automated bards almost everywhere so yeah I just use his phone and I can hack into bank accounts medical records security cameras roomers cool is it difficult hacking oh no it's really easy look if video games have taught me anything it's that no one bothers to lock down their CCTV cameras private terminals or doors with anything like a proper security system for instance from vending machines to security Bots everything electronic in Rapture has anti- medling circuitry that runs on Blue Goo instead of you know electrical signals who knew you could program security software with liquid the liquid moves through pipes are dam site slower than zeros and ones through network cable which makes rewiring raptures gizmos a cinch on the other hand if you fail it zaps the hell out of you which literally never happens when I type my email password in wrong ow speaking of passwords everyone in Gotham City needs to go back to password school and stop using the first words that pop into their heads such as the password serve protect for the Gotham Police Department it says that like your badge Gotham police all the password for the jail cells lockdown very clever this and the password for Penguin's ship the final offer is make a deal don't you know penguin you're supposed to use at least one number at least my Channel's password was I like cars with ones instead of eyes admittedly you do also need Batman's cryptographic sequencer to buy pass the city's security consoles and track down radio signals but he probably lend it to you if you ask him he seems nice time to talk where's cobblepot let me go if you insist Mass Effect is set in the 22nd century when the Galaxy's most widespread security technology for keeping Rogue Shepherds out of private terminals counts on Shepherd not being able to match two identical symbols or pages of text what does the text say is it code it doesn't even matter this one looks a bit like this one now give me all your credits and spaceships Fallout 3's monochrome terminals are lowf because all proper 21st century computers were lost in the great nuclear apocalypse so was all 21st Century Security technology it turns out because in the capital Wasteland computer security is powered by word puzzles this is easier even than a regular password system because unlike a regular password system it tells you when you're getting close to the right answer so it's not coyote or coated or chased but it's a bit like all of them aha not even Hotmail tells you when you're getting warmer thanks rco Industries hackers in the world world of DSX Human Revolution get to play a really fun mini game in which they balance risk and reward to get from one point in the network to the other I wonder everyone's doing it best of all unlike everything we've been led to believe about hacking it requires literally no programming skills you'll be able to wrap your head around this visual system of network nodes even if you struggle to configure presets on your car radio access granted it makes you wonder why sarif's head of cyber security Pritchard is so full of himself you fixed that firewall yet you don't fix an entire firewall you find the loophole and plug it then did you plug it yes I did want to know how oh wait I forgot X cop I doubt you'd understand now it's time to see what you've been saying in the comments and over the ox phone no still nothing that's a worthwhile investment first up your comments on last week's show about Wolfenstein the New Order and the worst history lessons gains taught us about World War II World War II video games like these are just about the worst history lesson you could get look ra of jiggly puff is confused saying so wait let me get this straight there weren't any Nazi zombies riding resurrected dinosaurs from space not according to reputable historians no and the disreputable ones oh yeah definitely according to them sweet Dave tones meanwhile asks with the connect or lack of news this week can you confirm that there is no choking out nazzis like Darth Vader in the new Wolfenstein game that is is just about the only way you can't kill Nazis in that game sorry Dave will cutter finally says a robo Nazi e well I didn't not see that come get it I'll come tried moving on your comments on the video game titles that are much more awesome in Japan video game title are routinely translated and or rejigged into amazingly Superior game names for the Japanese audience we had more great suggestions like this from Larry Bundy Jr who says the Japanese name for the Mega Drive game dicapac super magical flying hat turbo turban Adventure still holds the record for craziest title Mr mangy 17 meanwhile assures us Ratchet deadlocked was called ratchet gir gir Milky Way battle in Japan this will be your most intense challenge yet ratchet but I do believe you're well equipped to handle it but super cj12 thinks Streets of Rage is still a better title than bare knuckle H Bare knuckle though I used a pipe for most of their game they should have just called it pipe Fair Point finally your comments on us playing the first Titan for M pack Expedition all right all right monsters left Monsters ah monsters is that the same kind of monster as we had before similar isn't it it's pretty Flappy yeah another Flappy Monster Gage Ridley was inspired and says I heard Andy say future poops I'm now inspired to write an' 80s heavy metal song shouts at band we have a new project to work on now I guess like future poops I thought by this point they done found some way to convert it into like candy or something have I given away the theme of my concept album yeah you better hurry up and get on it before they do God damn it a a315 says if in the future they haven't worked out the whole poo into candy process I will be sorely disappointed what if they've done that already and just haven't told us I'll have that if you're not going to eat it meanwhile powder play thinks that they really missed a trick by not having the indigenous Wildlife involved in the battles just imagine having a gun battle with a group of guys only for a winged Beast to swoop down and grab you flinging you into the air as you look down to see both teams under assault by quadruped creatures but no all you get is set dressing actually speaking of set dressing I've been saying for a while we need to tidy this place up it's a right state so if you want to start on these boxes get those moved over there I'll move some of this Lo stuff into long-term storage it's Jane Jane not cool Jane why are there even traffic ballards in here that's it for show of the week but thanks for watching and if you liked it uh don't just give your screen a thumbs up because we can't see that but do hit the like button please on YouTube and drop us a line at outsidexbox on Twitter or facebook.com/ outsidexbox to say hi or other things see you next time hello hello it's

Now I come back, and this little\\nmother[bleep] Sputnik has done pissed\\non my drapes. Now I've got to get rid\\nof those things and get new ones. Neil, it doesn't\\nmake any sense. You are\\nan astrophysicist. How can you not keep track\\nof little details like this? Well, actually, it's the little details that cannot be kept track of,\\nby definition. In 1927, a German\\nuniversity lecturer named Werner Heisenberg came to a seemingly\\nparadoxical conclusion, that the more we know\\nabout the position of a particle\\nin physical space, the less we know about\\nits momentum, and vice versa. Okay, but what--\\nwhat does that have to do-- Taken in conjunction\\nwith what we know about the expansion\\nof the universe, this brings us\\nto a fascinating possibility, that maybe what we experience\\nas one point in time-space could actually be\\na legion of points, which would mean\\nthat your curtains and little Sputnik's pee-pee could be as distant\\nfrom one another as we are\\nfrom the furthest galaxy. Okay. Well, just...\\nnext time. Of course, dear. (woman)\\nNeil! There you are. What are you doing? We have to go\\nto my Aunt Nelly's funeral. How are you not ready? I've been talking to you\\nabout this all week. How am I gonna find you\\nin your boxers looking in\\na science magazine? [sighs] I swear, Neil, sometimes I think you don't have any idea\\nof what's important. Well...actually... an idea of what's important is as close\\nas we can ever come to any definition\\nof importance. Our galaxy is one of over 100 billion\\nin the observable universe, and it's 100,000\\nlight-years across, which means it would take light\\n100,000 years to traverse. Okay, but-- But that's just space. If we were to chart\\nthe history of the universe on one calendar year, the history of mankind\\nas we know it, would just take place in the final second\\nof that year. So, whether I'm ready now\\nor in 500 years, well, cosmically speaking, the distinction is meaningless. Well...okay. I'm--I'm going now. Good-bye, honey.\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': \"If you're looking for a way to save some cash\\non your utility bill, install a programmable thermostat. In the summertime they can be programmed to\\ncool the house when you're home and automatically raise the temperature while you're away for\\nthe day. And vice versa with heat during the winter. Some can even be controlled over Wi-Fi. Just be sure to get one that works with your\\nheating and cooling system. Installing a programmable thermostat is simple. Just be sure to read the instructions and\\nfollow any applicable building codes. If you are uncomfortable working with electricity\\nor your home's wiring appears incompatible, contact a licensed electrician for help. Start by turning off your old unit, and turning\\noff the furnace/AC breaker. Next, pop off the cover and thermostat, then\\nlabel where the wires are connected. The letters are what's important, not the\\ncolors. Take a picture for reference. Disconnect the wires and remove the mounting\\nscrews and plate. Tape the wires to the wall to keep them from\\nfalling inside the hole. Many old thermostats contain mercury. Call your local recycling center for disposal\\ninstructions. Let's say your new unit won't line up with\\nthe existing holes, you need to remove the anchors and repair the drywall. Now you're ready for the new thermostat. Check your owner's manual for specific steps. Typically you attach the plate first. Hold it in place—level—and mark the mounting\\nholes. Drill the holes and tap in wall anchors. Pull the wires through and attach the plate\\nwith screws. Next, reconnect the wires—if you don't have\\nboth R and Rc wires, leave the metal jumper. Wi-Fi units need a C wire. If your house doesn't have a C wire, first\\nconnect the G wire to the C terminal on the unit, then connect the other wires. At the furnace, move the G to the C terminal,\\nand install a short jumper, which you can make from 18-guage wire, from the Y to G terminal. This method will not allow you to control\\nthe fan. At the thermostat, snap the cover on, and\\nturn on the power. That's it. Follow the included instructions for set up\\nand connecting your Wi-Fi. Well, you're on your way to saving money,\\nand energy. Want more great ideas and how-tos? Just click to subscribe. Next up, learn how to help save more energy\\nwith a ceiling fan.\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': 'In this video we’ll show you how to install\\nbase cabinets. If you haven’t already watched the measure\\nand prep video, do that first. And remember - if you plan on installing a\\nfloating floor as part of your kitchen project, the cabinets go in first but must be raised\\nto a height just above the flooring. Otherwise you might have trouble installing\\nunder countertop appliances. You can cut plywood strips that are the thickness\\nof the floor and underlayment. Here’s a trick. Before you screw down the strips, level them\\nwith shims. This will make the install much easier. It’s also easier if you remove the doors\\nand drawers. Then just like installing the wall cabinets,\\nstart at a corner. Use the guides on the walls to transfer the\\nstud locations to the cabinets, accounting for the face frame. Drill the holes, and set the corner cab in\\nplace. The horizontal line is your main guide. Line up the top—shim underneath the base\\nand at the back to get it level and plumb. If the wall is extremely bowed, shims can\\nhelp keep the cabinet square and fill the space between the base and wall. When it looks good, drive in the screws at\\nthe back—just enough to hold it for now. You’ll tighten them later. For the next cabinet, drill the pilot holes\\nthrough the back, and position the cabinet next to the first. Even up the faces— shimming where needed—and\\nclamp the faces together. Drive screws in the back just to hold it for\\nnow. Next, drill pilot holes with a countersink/taper\\nbit through the face frames, and connect the cabinets with #8 screws. And that’s the gist of it. Here’s a tip if your wall is bowed. Glue shims over the stud lines where you’ll\\nsecure the mounting screws. This will prevent the cabinet backs from bowing\\nwhen you drive in the screws. To even up the cabinet tops near the wall,\\nyou’ll need to shim under the cabinet base against the wall. You can use the shim under the adjacent cabinet\\nas a guide. When you cut that shim, cut another for the\\nnext cabinet and leave it in place. Where you have plumbing or gas, cut the holes\\nin the back and install like the rest. Continue installing the cabinets but don’t\\ntighten the rear screws yet. Remember to keep the faces even and the tops\\nlined up with your reference line. All right, so what about that space at the\\nend? Easy fix with a filler strip. Mark and cut the filler strip. For uneven walls, clamp the filler piece to\\nthe frame, use a compass to scribe a line following the contours of the wall. And it helps to cut at a 7- to 10-degree bevel\\nto help fit the piece against the wall. Mark the width of the piece, and cut the cabinet\\nside. Use a plane for minor adjustments. Place the piece, drill holes through the frame,\\nand attach with screws. Once you have all of the cabinets in, tighten\\nthe rear screws and remove the clamps. Any places where you don’t have a cabinet\\nframe to support the countertop, like end walls and corners, attach 1x2s with screws. After your cabinets are secured, cut toekicks\\nto fit and attach with finish nails. For floating floors do this after they’re\\ninstalled. Don’t add the doors and drawers just yet. You still have to attach the countertops. Want more great ideas and how-to’s? Go to Lowes.com/HowTo or just click to subscribe. Next up, installing laminate countertops.'},\n",

       "  'transcript': 'The general diesel engine operating principles\\xa0\\nshown apply to diesel cars and pickup trucks\\xa0\\xa0 as well as heavier duty diesel trucks, which are\\xa0\\nused in this video for illustrative purposes only. In diesel engines the operating cycle starts\\xa0\\nwith clean air being drawn into the cylinder,\\xa0\\xa0 not a fuel air mixture as in a\\xa0\\nconventional gasoline engine. The motion of the piston compresses the\\xa0\\nair, heating it to a high temperature.\\xa0\\xa0 When the piston nears the top of\\xa0\\nthe cylinder, fuel is injected\\xa0\\xa0 under high pressure through a number of precisely\\xa0\\nmachined holes in the tip of the fuel injector. The fuel enters the engine\\xa0\\nin the form of a fine spray,\\xa0\\xa0 and the surface of each droplet quickly begins\\xa0\\nto vaporize on its path through the hot air. Spontaneous ignition takes place without the need\\xa0\\nfor a spark, and rapid expansion of the combusting\\xa0\\xa0 mixture increases the pressure in the cylinder,\\xa0\\nforcing the piston down and powering the vehicle. When the piston is close to its lowest position\\xa0\\nthe exhaust valve starts to open, and the exhaust\\xa0\\xa0 stroke then drives the spent gases out of the\\xa0\\ncombustion chamber and the cycle starts again. In conventional gasoline engines a mixture of fuel\\xa0\\nand air is drawn into the cylinder, compressed by\\xa0\\xa0 the motion of the piston, and ignited by a spark\\xa0\\nas the piston nears the top of the cylinder. The resulting combustion generates pressure which\\xa0\\nforces the piston down to power the vehicle.'},\n",

       "  'transcript': \"Transcriber:  Are we designed to nap during the day? [Sleeping With Science] Most people aim to get their\\nrecommended seven to nine hours of sleep in one long stretch at night. And the technical term for this\\nis “monophasic sleep.” In other words, a single bout\\nof sleep at night. However, we may not have been programmed\\nto sleep in this way. Now I'm sure you've had that experience of a drop in your alertness\\nin the afternoon, where you start to feel a little sleepy. And you can also see it\\nin other people as well, as their heads begin\\nsort of bobbing up and down during afternoon meetings. Now you may think this afternoon\\ndrop in your alertness is because of a big lunch, but in actual fact, it seems to be hardwired. Because if I place\\nelectrodes on your head, there is a reliable, preprogrammed drop in your brain’s alertness\\nduring the afternoon. And it happens to most of us somewhere\\nbetween the one to four pm mark. What this suggests is that we may have been designed\\nto sleep in a biphasic pattern, meaning one longer bout of sleep at night and then a short afternoon nap\\nduring the day, very much like the siesta cultures\\naround the world. But is napping always a good thing? Well, not necessarily. Although we and other scientists have discovered\\nthat naps can have benefits for both the brain and for the body, naps can be a double-edged sword. Long naps in the afternoon\\nor in the early evening can just take the edge\\noff your sleepiness. It's a little bit like snacking\\nbefore your main meal. So if you are struggling\\nwith sleep at night, the best advice\\nis not to nap during the day. Instead, build up\\nall of that healthy sleepiness so that you give yourself the best chance\\nof falling asleep easily and then staying asleep\\nsoundly across the night. But if you're not struggling with sleep and you can nap regularly during the day, the naps of around 20 minutes\\ntaken early in the day can be just fine.\"},\n",

PHILIP SIMPSON: Hi, I'm Philip. I work at Shifty Jelly. I'm a co-founder, but\\nalso an Android developer. RUSSELL IVANOVIC: We decided we\\nwanted to get into mobile apps. So we'd see each other\\nevery day at work, and then we'd to go home\\non the couch, sit back, and we start coding. PHILIP SIMPSON: And we\\ndid that for two years. It's been worth it, the fact\\nthat we can actually go create our own company off of it. RUSSELL IVANOVIC:\\nShifty Jelly is an Adelaide-based mobile\\ndevelopment company. PHILIP SIMPSON: And\\nwe've grown now. So we've got our\\ndesigner, Chris. We've got Monica, who\\nhelps us with support. We've just taken on\\nanother developer. So the team's\\ngrowing and growing. RUSSELL IVANOVIC: We've\\nalways wanted to create apps that we want to use our self. We really got into\\npodcasts in a big way, and there was no\\ngood apps for it. And we thought, what's\\nthe first brand new app we can bring out now that\\nwe're working full time? And that's where\\nPocket Casts started. PHILIP SIMPSON: I\\njust really wanted to sell one bit of\\nsoftware to someone. But now we're number\\none in the chart and people are actually\\nusing it around the country. RUSSELL IVANOVIC: One thing\\nthat was really exciting that happened recently is\\nwe actually cast $1 million worth of Pocket Casts hours. And that's a really\\nbig milestone. To put out just one\\napplication on one platform? And there's half a million\\npeople using it now. We're always looking for new\\nfeatures to give our customers. They're always\\nsaying, what's new? What's new? And, with the pace\\nthat Android moves at, we're always able to\\ngive them something new. PHILIP SIMPSON: So we've\\nadded the Wear support, we've added Chromecast support,\\nAndroid Auto, and one of them was material design. And we think it's\\nreally paid off and made our app much better. RUSSELL IVANOVIC:\\nWe found that when we switched to material design,\\nwhen we updated our app, when we embraced all these new things\\nthat Google was giving us, we found our sales actually\\nsee increased by 30%. And the reception\\nwe had was amazing. People love it. They see this brand\\nnew design of an app they're familiar with, but\\njust a different take on it. PHILIP SIMPSON: We recently\\nimplemented media sessions. It allowed our users to have a\\nconsistent playback experience across all their\\ndifferent devices. And it made our life, as\\ndevelopers, much easier. RUSSELL IVANOVIC: One of\\nthe most exciting things we got to work on was the\\nAndroid Auto platform. So you plug your phone in\\nand, bang, play your podcasts. It's just really cool. And there's a really\\nnice forum around that. So you can just jump on the\\nforum and within five minutes, someone's on there saying,\\nhave you tried this? Have you tried that? And we found that\\nreally different to any other platform. It seems like, in the Android\\nspace, you do something good, you put it out to the world,\\nand they make it even better. PHILIP SIMPSON: Google's\\nalways improving their software, their\\nAPIs, so that really helps us out as well. And it makes our\\nlife a lot easier. Just this new technology\\ncoming out all time is really exciting for me. So I can't wait to\\nsee what Google's going to bring out next.\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': 'Lupus is an autoimmune disease where your body’s\\nimmune system attacks healthy cells and tissue. It most often affects women, but men can get it too. Although most sufferers no longer die of lupus,\\nit can still pose serious, sometimes-fatal complications, such as kidney damage and cardiovascular disease. Here are five early signs of lupus to pay\\nattention to. Extreme fatigue, where you’re feeling tired\\nall the time and lack energy no matter how much sleep you get, may be cause for concern. Talk to your doctor if you find it hard to\\ndo everyday activities like take a shower, go to work or cook dinner. One of the most distinctive signs of lupus\\nis a butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks and nose. Rashes can also appear on your hands or wrists. They usually last a few\\ndays to weeks, but some can be permanent. Another early symptom to look out for is joint\\npain – with or without swelling. It affects hands, knees and feet most often, and your joints may feel tender and warm to the\\ntouch. A sharp, stabbing pain in your\\nchest — especially when you take a deep breath, cough, sneeze or laugh — is another\\nsign to watch for. It could be caused by inflammation of your\\nlungs’ outer lining due to lupus. Also take note of severe headaches that are\\npersistent and don’t get better with  over-the-counter headache medication. All of these symptoms can range from mild\\nto severe and can develop suddenly  or over time. Some may be temporary, others permanent, and\\nnew symptoms can occur at any time. It’s also important to remember that a number\\nof other diseases have some of the same symptoms as lupus, so please see your doctor\\nto get an accurate diagnosis.

just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality it connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen

now so as I'm speaking I'm feeling the sonic world around me we've been testing this with deaf people now and it turns out that after just a little bit of time people can start feeling they can start understanding the language of the vest we do 3 million miles of testing in our simulators every single day so you can imagine the experience our vehicles have we are looking forward to having this technology on the road how soon can we bring it out these are my two boys my oldest son is 11 and that means in four and a half years he's going to be able to get his driver's license my team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen okay so relax don't hit it right now your brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm so go ahead and just do it one more time it says perfect machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make the machines would them be better at the bending than we are we should not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligence genie locked up in its bottle forever the answer here is to figure out how to create super intelligent AI such that even if when it escaped it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values the Islamic state beheadings are not ancient or remote they're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us there is a very personal price to public humiliation and the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price when we say that black lives matter it's not because others don't it's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear when so many things tell us we are not I want to live in a world where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy can we imagine in a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery prevention Civic inclusion rather than punishment a criminal justice system that believes in black young people rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up if you are fleeing a war zone a better life is alive in safety its life in dignity a better life means not having a house bombs not fearing being kidnapped it means being able to send a children to school or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love there are still tragedies that happen in the bumpy road to equality but there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination I'm not saying that in all of you there's a secret sexist or racist or urges like lurking within waiting to get out bias is not an accusation rather it's something that has to be identified acknowledged and mitigated against we have to start making stopping violence indispensable to the fight against poverty in fact any conversation about global poverty that doesn't include the problem of violence must be deemed not serious the quarter truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing what if we realized that the experts we are looking for the experts we need to follow are poor people themselves these big issues that will change the world change national security change economics create hope create threats can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few Superman or super women now we need everybody everybody underestimates how often they laugh when you laugh with people that's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system to regulate emotions to make ourselves feel better some affairs add bethe nails for relationships that were already dying on the vine but others will jolt us into new possibilities the opposite of addiction is not sobriety the opposite of addiction is connection for most people the scariest thing about death isn't being dead it's dying I am asking we make space physical psychic room to allow life to play itself all the way out so that rather than just getting out of the way aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen you might have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice that's why people often confuse me with the GPS I am a bad feminist I am a good woman I am trying to become better and how I think and what I say and what I do without abandoning everything that makes me human the tool was bought four days in your life the day you're born and they do discover why and sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork or it could empower me I chose to be empowered maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important

IT\\'S OVER 4,000 NAUTICAL MILES\\n FROM JAPAN TO PEARL.   THAT\\'S A LONG DISTANCE\\n  TO STEAM A NAVY, CAPTAIN.   YOUR THEORY\\n  IS BASED ON WHAT?    WELL, IT\\'S WHAT\\n   I WOULD DO.  THAT\\'S NOT EXACTLY HARD\\n EVIDENCE, CAPTAIN THURMAN. WELL, ADMIRAL,\\nIF I HAD HARD EVIDENCE, WE\\'D ALREADY BE AT WAR. SIR, WE CAN READ\\nTHEIR DIPLOMATIC CODES,   BUT CAPTAIN THURMAN\\'S\\n  CRYPTOLOGY TEAM    IS STILL TRYING TO CRACK\\n   THE NAVAL CODES. THE INTERCEPTS HAVE MISSING\\nWORDS AND GARBLED LINES, SO TO EXPLAIN THE DECRYPTS,    WE HAVE\\n   TO TRY TO INTERPRET   WHAT WE THINK\\n  THEY\\'RE TRYING TO DO.  INTERPRET? YOU MEAN GUESS. THEY USE THEIR INFORMED\\nINTUITION, SIR.    WE GUESS.   IT\\'S LIKE PLAYING\\n  CHESS IN THE DARK.  ANY RUMOR, TROOP MOVEMENT,\\n SHIP MOVEMENT,   SPINE-TINGLE, GOOSE BUMP,\\n  WE PAY ATTENTION TO IT.    WHEN I WAS IN\\n   THE ASIATIC FLEET, THE LOCALS USED TO TRY\\nTO GET OUTSIDE OF A PROBLEM   TO TRY TO SEE THE INSIDE.    I SEE A STRIKE ON PEARL.    IT\\'S THE WORST THING\\n   THAT COULD HAPPEN.    A BLOW TO PEARL    WOULD DEVASTATE THE PACIFIC\\n   FLEET\\'S ABILITY TO MAKE WAR.    SO, SIR, YOU WOULD HAVE\\n   US MOBILIZE THE ENTIRE FLEET  AT THE COST\\n OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS    BASED ON THIS SPINE-TINGLING\\n   FEELING OF YOURS?    NO, SIR.    I UNDERSTAND MY JOB IS TO GATHER\\nAND INTERPRET MATERIAL.  MAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS BASD\\n ON INCOMPLETE INFORMATION    FROM MY LIMITED\\n   DECODING ABILITY    IS YOUR JOB, SIR.    THEN BREAK THE DAMN\\n   NAVAL CODE, CAPTAIN,  SO I CAN MAKE\\n A BETTER DECISION.    AYE, SIR.    WE ARE TRYING.  I WONDER IF WE SHOULDN\\'T PUT\\n THE PACIFIC FLEET ON FULL ALER.

IT IS OBVIOUS    THAT PLANNING THE ATTACK\\n   BEGAN MANY WEEKS AGO.   DURING\\n  THE INTERVENING TIME, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT\\nHAS DELIBERATELY SOUGHT    TO DECEIVE THE UNITED STATES\\n   BY FALSE STATEMENTS AND EXPRESSIONS OF HOPE\\nFOR CONTINUED PEACE. THE ATTACK YESTERDAY\\nON THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS    HAS CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE\\n   TO AMERICAN MILITARY FORCES.    I REGRET TO TELL YOU  THAT OVER 3,000 AMERICAN LIVES\\n HAVE BEEN LOST.  NO MATTER HOW LONG\\n IT MAY TAKE US TO OVERCOME\\nTHIS PREMEDITATED INVASION,   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,\\n  IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS MIGHT,    WILL WIN THROUGH\\n   TO ABSOLUTE VICTORY.  ( APPLAUSE )  BECAUSE OF THIS...    UNPROVOKED, DASTARDLY ATTACK\\n   BY JAPAN, I ASK THAT THE CONGRESS\\nDECLARE A STATE OF WAR.  IS IT TRUE... MEN ARE STILL TRAPPED ALIVE\\nINSIDE THE ARIZONA?   WE CAN HEAR TAPPING\\n  FROM INSIDE THE HULL.   WE\\'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN\\n  TO GET TO THEM,    BUT THEY\\'RE\\n   40 FEET BELOW WATER.

THAT\\'S EXACTLY WHY\\nWE HAVE TO STRIKE BACK NOW.   WE\\'RE PREPARING AN ATTACK\\n  AGAINST THE MARSHALL\\nAND GILBERT ISLANDS, SIR --  I\\'M TALKING ABOUT\\n HITTING THE HEART OF JAPAN   THE WAY THEY HAVE HIT US.    MR. PRESIDENT...  PEARL HARBOR\\n CAUGHT US UNAWARES   BECAUSE WE DIDN\\'T\\n  FACE FACTS.    THIS ISN\\'T A TIME\\n   FOR IGNORING THEM AGAIN. ARMY AIR CORPS\\nHAS LONG-RANGE BOMBERS, BUT NO PLACE\\nTO LAUNCH THEM.   MIDWAY IS TOO FAR,\\n  AND RUSSIA WON\\'T ALLOW US  TO LAUNCH\\n A RAID FROM THERE.  ADMIRAL?    NAVY\\'S PLANES ARE SMALL. THEY CARRY LIGHT LOADS\\nAND HAVE A SHORT RANGE.  WE\\'D HAVE TO GET THEM WITHIN A\\n FEW HUNDRED MILES OF JAPAN  AND THEREFORE RISK OUR CARRIER,\\n AND IF WE LOSE OUR CARRIERS,    WE\\'LL HAVE NO SHIELD\\n   AGAINST INVASION.  DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM\\n THINK THAT VICTORY IS POSSIBLE  WITHOUT FACING DANGER?   WE ARE AT WAR.\\n  OF COURSE THERE\\'S A RISK.  BUT CONSIDER THE RISK,\\n MR. PRESIDENT.    IF THE JAPANESE\\n   INVADE US RIGHT NOW,    THEY WOULD PENETRATE\\n   AS FAR AS CHICAGO  BEFORE WE COULD STOP THEM.  GENTLEMEN...  MOST OF YOU DID NOT KNOW ME\\n WHEN I HAD THE USE OF MY LEGS.

BUT WHEN I SEE DEFEAT IN\\n THE EYES OF MY COUNTRYMEN,    IN YOUR EYES, RIGHT NOW, I START TO THINK THAT MAYBE\\nHE BROUGHT ME DOWN    FOR TIMES LIKE THESE  WHEN WE ALL NEED TO BE\\n REMINDED WHO WE TRULY ARE, THAT WE WILL NOT\\nGIVE UP OR GIVE IN.  MR. PRESIDENT,\\n WITH ALL RESPECT, SIR,  WHAT YOU\\'RE ASKING\\n CAN\\'T BE DONE.  MR. PRESIDENT!\\n MR. PRESIDENT!   GET BACK, GEORGE!  GET BACK.   DO NOT TELL ME...   IT CAN\\'T BE DONE.

( PLAYING \"TAPS\" )   Man: AND WHERE IS GOD\\n  IN ALL THIS?    OUR ENEMIES BELIEVE THAT\\n   A DIVINE WIND PROTECTS THEM.    BUT WE SEE OUR FRIENDS\\n   LAID OUT HERE BEFORE US.   HEY, CAPTAIN.  LIEUTENANTS RAFE McCAWLEY,\\n DANIEL WALKER?  YES, MAJOR?    YOU\\'RE BOTH GOING STATESIDE.\\n   FLY OUT IN TWO HOURS.  WHAT FOR, SIR? ASK COL. DOOLITTLE.    YES, SIR.    YOU\\'RE PACKING.    ORDERS.    WHAT KIND OF ORDERS?   ( SIGHS )    THE TOP-SECRET KIND.    THE DANGEROUS KIND.    I CAN\\'T FIND DANNY.    IS THAT WHY YOU\\'RE HERE?  LOOKING FOR DANNY?    HE\\'S PROBABLY SAYING GOODBYE\\n   TO HIS SQUADRON. WE\\'VE BEEN ASSIGNED\\nTO DOOLITTLE.    I WASN\\'T LOOKING\\n   FOR DANNY.    I COULDN\\'T\\n   HAVE YOU GO AWAY    WITHOUT YOU\\n   UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING.  YEAH. WELL, YOU DON\\'T HAVE\\n TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO ME. I DO, BECAUSE YOU\\'RE ACTING\\nLIKE I DIDN\\'T LOVE YOU.  EVELYN, LOVING YOU\\n KEPT ME ALIVE.    I SHOULD\\'VE DIED\\n   OVER THERE.   WHEN I WAS IN THAT WATER,\\n  I MADE A DEAL WITH GOD. I TOLD HIM I WAS SORRY, I KNEW I\\'D BEEN\\nA FOOL FOR LEAVING YOU, TRYING TO GO OVER THERE\\nAND BE A HERO,   AND I PROMISED I\\'D NEVER\\n  ASK FOR ANYTHING AGAIN... IF I COULD JUST SEE YOU\\nONE MORE TIME.    AND YOU KNOW WHAT?    IT WAS WORTH IT.    YOU KEPT ME ALIVE,\\n   EVELYN.    YOU BROUGHT ME HOME.   SO I\\'M GONNA STAND BY\\n  MY END OF THE DEAL,    I\\'M GONNA WALK AWAY,    AND I WON\\'T ASK YOU\\n   FOR ANYTHING.    BUT I JUST WANT\\n   TO KNOW WHY.   JUST TELL ME THAT,\\n  WILL YOU, PLEASE?    JUST TELL ME WHY. RAFE, I\\'M PREGNANT.    OH, MY GOD.    I DIDN\\'T EVEN KNOW UNTIL\\n   THE DAY YOU TURNED UP ALIVE.   I HAVEN\\'T TOLD DANNY.   I DON\\'T WANT HIM TO KNOW.    ALL HE NEEDS\\n   TO THINK ABOUT   IS HOW TO DO THIS MISSION\\n  AND GET BACK ALIVE. RAFE, ALL I EVER WANTED  WAS FOR US TO HAVE A HOME,\\n GROW OLD TOGETHER, BUT LIFE NEVER ASKED ME\\nWHAT I WANTED. NOW, I\\'M GONNA GIVE\\nDANNY MY WHOLE HEART... BUT I DON\\'T THINK I\\'LL EVER\\nLOOK AT ANOTHER SUNSET    WITHOUT THINKING OF YOU. I\\'LL LOVE YOU\\nMY WHOLE LIFE.    I\\'LL SEE YOU\\n   ON BOARD.    YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING\\n   THAT SCARES ME...  IS THAT YOU MIGHT LOVE HIM\\n MORE THAN YOU LOVE ME.  I LOVE YOU, DANNY. AND I\\'LL BE HERE WAITING\\nFOR YOU WHEN YOU COME BACK.  FOLLOW ME.  COLONEL. CONGRATULATIONS\\nON YOUR PROMOTION, SIR.   I HEARD WHAT YOU DID.   WE CAN EXPLAIN THAT, SIR.  EXPLAIN WHAT?    WHATEVER IT IS YOU HEARD\\n   ABOUT US, SIR.    YOU MEAN THE HULA SHIRTS\\n   YOU WERE FLYING IN? OR THE SEVEN PLANES\\nYOU SHOT DOWN?   YOU\\'RE BOTH BEING AWARDED\\n  THE SILVER STAR...    AND PROMOTED TO CAPTAIN.  IS THAT THE GOOD NEWS,\\n SIR, OR... YOU\\'RE JUST ABOUT\\nTHE ONLY PILOTS IN THE ARMY WITH COMBAT EXPERIENCE.   I NEED YOU FOR A MISSION I\\'VE\\n  BEEN ORDERED TO PUT TOGETHER.   YOU KNOW WHAT\\n  TOP SECRET IS?    YES, SIR.    IT\\'S THE KIND OF MISSION\\n   WHERE YOU GET MEDALS...   BUT THEY SEND \\'EM\\n  TO YOUR RELATIVES. TOP SECRET MEANS\\nYOU TRAIN FOR SOMETHING    NEVER DONE BEFORE\\n   IN AVIATION HISTORY,  AND YOU GO WITHOUT KNOWING\\n WHERE YOU\\'RE GOING. YOU DO IT ON THAT BASIS\\nOR NOT AT ALL.    I\\'LL GO, SIR.  I\\'LL GO, TOO, SIR.   BY THE WAY,\\n  THE BRITS SENT THIS OVER. IT\\'S YOUR PERSONAL EFFECTS.    THANK YOU, SIR. THERE\\'S ONLY ONE MORE THING\\nI CAN TELL YOU.    LEAVE YOUR DAMN\\n   HULA SHIRTS AT HOME.  THE MISSION I\\'M ASKING YOU\\n TO VOLUNTEER FOR IS EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS.  TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAN\\n BESIDE YOU.   IT\\'S A GOOD BET\\n  THAT IN THE NEXT 6 WEEKS,  YOU OR HE...  WILL BE DEAD.   EVERYONE BRAVE ENOUGH\\n  TO ACCEPT THIS...  STEP FORWARD.   YOUR GRANDMOTHER\\n  COULD TAKE A B-25 OFF  ON A MILE-LONG RUNWAY.   WELL, I\\'M GONNA TRAIN YOU\\n  TO DO IT IN 467 FEET.  BECAUSE AT 468 FEET...  YOU\\'RE DEAD. AND ONCE YOU GET IT UP,  YOU\\'LL LEARN TO FLY IT\\n LIKE A FIGHTER... 30 FEET OFF THE GROUND. I WANT YOU TO SAY HELLO    TO LIEUTENANT JACK RICHARDS,\\n   NAVY AVIATION.  HE\\'S GONNA HELP US\\n LIGHTEN THESE FAT LADIES HERE.   DUMP THAT ASHCAN.    SEE THAT BOMB SIGHT?\\n   GET RID OF IT.    COLONEL, HE\\'S CRAZY! THE LADY\\'S FAT!    LISTEN TO HIM.  SHE\\'S A FAT LADY.\\n WE WANT A SKINNY LADY!  MAX POWER! GET UP, GET UP!    HOW THE HECK--  DAMN! THEY JUST KEEP ROLLING PAST\\nTHAT LINE.    MAYBE THIS MISSION\\'S\\n   A BAD IDEA.  NO, THEY\\'RE TOO HEAVY.\\n WE GOTTA GET DRASTIC.  THIS ARMORED PLATING\\'S\\n GOT TO GO!  I\\'M SURE, I\\'M SURE.\\n LOSE IT LIKE A SKIRT, SON. RELEASE BRAKES!   COME ON, COME ON!  GOD!    PUT EVERY MAN\\n   ON THE LINE, NOW! LET\\'S SHOW THESE BOYS\\nHOW THIS THING IS DONE!    COME ON!\\n   MAX POWER.  ( CHEERING )    WELL, IF HE CAN DO IT --  ( LAUGHS )    ( LAUGHS ) Doolittle: WELL, GENTLEMEN,\\nNOW I CAN TELL YOU  THAT WE\\'RE GOING TO TOKYO,    AND WE\\'RE GONNA BOMB IT.  ( CHEERING )   THAT COMES\\n  AS A SPECIAL REQUEST,    DIRECTLY FROM\\n   PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.   THE NAVY\\'S GONNA SNEAK US ABOUT 400 MILES OFF\\nTHE JAPANESE COAST, AND WE\\'LL LAUNCH\\nFROM THE CARRIER THERE. HAS THAT EVER EVEN BEEN\\nDONE BEFORE?   TAKING ARMY BOMBERS\\n  OFF OF NAVY CARRIERS?  NO.    OK.    ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?   WELL, SIR, IS IT\\n  EVEN POSSIBLE TO LAND   A B-25 ON AN AIRCRAFT\\n  CARRIER DECK?  THAT WON\\'T MATTER.  AS SOON AS WE\\'RE AIRBORNE,  THE CARRIER WILL HEAD STRAIGHT\\n BACK FOR HAWAII.  BUT IF THE CARRIERS HEAD HOME,\\n WHERE DO WE LAND? I HAVE A PHRASE\\nI WANT YOU TO MEMORIZE.    ( SPEAKING CHINESE )  IT MEANS \"I AM AN AMERICAN\"...  IN CHINESE.    AIN\\'T GONNA BE\\n   ANY EASIER.   THAT\\'S 3 FEET SHORTER\\n  THAN OUR PRACTICE RUNWAY.  FELLAS?    SIR.    SIR.   THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY\\n  GAVE ME THESE.    WHAT ARE THEY?    FRIENDSHIP MEDALS\\n   THE JAPANESE GAVE US   WHEN THEY WERE PRETENDING\\n  THEY WANTED PEACE.   WHAT DID HE WANT YOU\\n  TO DO WITH THEM, SIR?  WIRE THEM TO THE BOMBS\\n AND GIVE THEM BACK. SO WHAT\\'S GOING ON?  WELL, SIR, WE ONLY\\n HAVE 16 PLANES.  SO? WHEN THE JAPS HIT US,\\nTHEY HAD MORE THAN 300.   HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE\\n  ARE WE REALLY GONNA MAKE?    IT\\'S NOT THAT\\n   WE\\'RE AFRAID, SIR. IT\\'S JUST THAT WE MIGHT\\nDIE DOING THIS,    AND WE WANT TO KNOW\\n   WHAT IT\\'S FOR.  YOU KNOW, AT PEARL,\\n THEY HIT US WITH A SLEDGEHAMME. THIS RAID,\\nEVEN IF WE MAKE IT THROUGH,   IT\\'LL ONLY BE A PINPRICK,   BUT IT\\'LL BE STRAIGHT\\n  THROUGH THEIR HEARTS. VICTORY BELONGS TO THOSE\\nTHAT BELIEVE IN IT THE MOST   AND BELIEVE IN IT\\n  THE LONGEST.    WE\\'RE GONNA BELIEVE.   WE\\'RE GONNA MAKE\\n  AMERICA BELIEVE, TOO.    Man: COLONEL?\\n   I NEED A MINUTE. EXCUSE ME,\\nMAJOR JACKSON?\\nYES? DO YOU REMEMBER ME?    OH, SURE I DO.   I\\'M SORRY. I\\'VE BEEN\\n  MEANING TO THANK YOU.    WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN.  WHEN THE NEWS STARTS COMING IN    ABOUT THOSE BOYS\\n   IN THE DOOLITTLE OUTFIT,    I WANT TO BE\\n   IN THE COMMAND POST.  I\\'M SORRY. I DON\\'T KNOW\\n WHAT YOU\\'RE TALKING ABOUT.  HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW\\n ABOUT THIS MISSION, LIEUTENANT?  LET\\'S CALL IT\\n AN INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE.  SOME FLY BOY YOU\\'RE DATING\\n SHOT HIS MOUTH OFF.    ACTUALLY,\\n   IT\\'S ABOUT 2 PILOTS.    I KNOW THEY\\'RE GOING\\n   INTO GREAT DANGER. I JUST WANT TO BE THERE\\nWHEN THE NEWS COMES IN   TO TELLS US\\n  IF THEY\\'VE LIVED OR DIED.    ( SIGHS )    MOST OFFICERS WOULD HAVE\\n   THROWN YOU IN THE BRIG.  MOST NURSES WOULD HAVE GONE ON\\n TO SOMEONE ELSE  INSTEAD OF KEEPING THEIR FINGES\\n PLUGGED IN YOUR ARTERY.   ( ENGINE TURNS OVER )    I CAN\\'T PROMISE YOU\\n   ANYTHING.    HEY, RED,\\n   YOU THINK THEY PICKED US   TO DO THIS \\'CAUSE\\n  WE\\'RE YOUNG AND DUMB? COME ON, GOOZ,\\nWE\\'RE THE TIP OF THE SWORD.    IN HONOR OF OUR TRIP\\n   TO JAPAN,    I GOT US\\n   SOME VICTORY CIGARS!   YEAH, VICTORY CIGARS!\\n  THERE YOU GO.  PUT THAT IN YOUR INSIDE POCKET,\\n NEXT TO YOUR HEART.    YOU KNOW, JACK,\\n   WE MAY LOSE THIS BATTLE,    BUT WE\\'RE GONNA\\n   WIN THIS WAR.    YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW?    NO.    THEM.    \\'CAUSE THEY\\'RE RARE.    AND AT TIMES LIKE THESE,\\n   YOU SEE THEM...    STEPPING FORWARD.  THERE\\'S NOTHING STRONGER THAN\\n THE HEART OF A VOLUNTEER, JACK.  MY FRIENDS IN THE WAR DEPARTMET\\n DON\\'T WANT ME TO LEAD THIS RAI,   BECAUSE THEY SAY\\n  I\\'M TOO VALUABLE.  THEY DON\\'T WANT ME\\n UP IN THE AIR FLYING WITH THE MEN\\nTHAT I\\'VE CHOSEN,   THAT I\\'VE CHEWED OUT,  CUSSED OUT,\\n PUSHED TO THE LIMIT...   AND THAT\\n  I\\'VE COME TO RESPECT.   THEY WANT ME TO STAND ON THE\\n  FLIGHT DECK AND WAVE YOU OFF.  WELL, I DON\\'T SEE IT THAT WAY.  SO I\\'M GOING WITH YOU. WE TAKE OFF\\nTOMORROW AFTERNOON, DROP OUR FIRE,\\nAND HEAD FOR CHINA.    OUR MISSION IS\\n   TO HIT MILITARY TARGETS, AIRCRAFT,\\nAND TANK FACTORIES.    COLONEL.   YOU\\'VE GIVEN US\\n  THE HOMING BEACONS,  BUT YOU\\'VE ALSO TOLD US CHINA S\\n OVERRUN WITH JAPANESE TROOPS.    WHAT DO WE DO IF THE BEACONS\\n   ARE SWITCHED OFF?  YOU BRING HER DOWN\\n ANY WAY YOU CAN   AND DO YOUR BEST\\n  TO AVOID CAPTURE. WHAT DO WE DO IF OUR PLANES\\nARE DAMAGED AND WE HAVE TO BAIL OUT\\nOVER JAPAN?    WELL, IN THAT SITUATION, I CAN\\'T TELL YOU\\nWHAT YOU SHOULD DO.    WHAT WOULD YOU DO,\\n   COLONEL?   I WASN\\'T BUILT\\n  TO BE A PRISONER,   SO I WOULD HAVE\\n  MY CREW BAIL OUT. I\\'D FIND THE SWEETEST\\nMILITARY TARGET I COULD AND DRIVE MY PLANE RIGHT\\nSMACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF IT  AND KILL AS MANY OF\\n THOSE BUMS AS I POSSIBLY COULD. BUT THAT\\'S JUST ME.   I\\'M 45 YEARS OLD.\\n  I\\'M AN OLD MAN.    YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR WHOLE\\n   LIVES AHEAD OF YOU,    SO WHAT YOU DO IS UP TO YOU. THE MISSION WILL LAUNCH\\nIN A COUPLE OF HOURS.  YOU\\'LL STAY RIGHT IN HERE. HERE. STAY HERE.\\nDON\\'T TALK TO THEM. THEY WON\\'T TALK TO YOU.    PRETEND TO TYPE WHATEVER\\n   INFORMATION WE PASS YOU.  THAT\\'S IT. Woman: THIS IS ORPHAN ANNIE\\nFROM RADIO TOKYO.   TO ALL THE LONELY BOYS\\n  IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, WATCH OUT.\\nTHE ENEMY WILL GET YOU.    MAYBE SHE\\'S RIGHT.

For longtime residents of Chinatown, it was too late to effect conjugal reunions, but many older Chinese-American men wanted their sons to provide them with grandchildren by finding brides in China. © 1989 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

       "  'description': \"In Kartemquin's American Arab, Iraqi-born Director Usama Alshaibi takes a provocative look at the contradictions of Arab identity in post 9/11 America, weaving his own life’s journey and “coming-of-Arab” experiences into the life stories of several diverse characters. Exploring the values, passions, and hopes of his fellow Arab-Americans, Usama tries to make peace with his conflicted chosen homeland. Arab-Americans are not one monolithic group, but rather a diverse and complex array of many voices and cultures. This film weaves sadness and humor, anger and satire, provocation and understanding, embracing the multifaceted Arab American experience of post 9/11 America. By shedding light and giving clarity to a recent and difficult time for Arabs living in the US, American Arab shows how the struggles over identity within this documentary are universal.\",\n",

The guys have nearly recovered from their roofie'd nights of Las Vegas and being kidnapped, shot at, and chased by mobsters in Bangkok. The only member of the Wolfpack who's not content is Alan. Still lacking a sense of purpose, he has ditched his meds and given in to his natural impulses in a big way-until a personal crisis forces him to finally seek the help of his three best friends. With no bachelor party and no wedding, what could possibly go wrong? But when the Wolfpack hits the road, all bets are off. It is the epic conclusion to an odyssey of mayhem and bad decisions, in which the guys must finish what they started by going back to where it all began: Las Vegas. One way or another...it all ends here. #Trailer #WB\",\n",
